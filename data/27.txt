Introduction
The first more detailed zoological study about the Adriatic eastern
coast may have been published in 1792 [1]. The first researches on the
Adriatic region in the first part 18th century were run by the Natural
History Museum of Trieste. In the middle of the century, there were two
major memorable possibilities for the Hungarian scientists: between
1857-1859 the round the world expedition on the Frigate “Novara”,
which was the first among the modern oceanography investigations,
and between 1872-1874 the Austro Hungarian North-Pole expedition,
when the “Franz Josef land” was discovered. The first detailed book on
the Adriatic algae was published in 1863 [2].
In 1872 Anton Dohm founded the very first oceanography institute
in Naples, where the Hungarian Geza Entz Sen. worked sometimes
from 1883, and published his basic study in 1884 about the Gulf of
Naples. One of his best friends, Salvatore Lo Bianco later had big role
to base later the Hungarian oceanography [3].
Forming and Operation of the Hungarian Station
Owing to Professor Claus of Vienna, and Professor Schulze of Graz
works in 1875 the Marine Biological Station of Trieste was founded. In
the 1870-80 years, on the Adriatic mostly biological detailed researches
were run, which by the austrians were done mostly on the “Hertha”
yacht, by the Hungarians on the “Deli”, “Nautilus”, and “Pelagosa”
vessels.
According to historical reminescences then till the regular using of
the Trieste station, and getting new research boats, the “Argo”, and the
“Adria” there was longer calm period. The first publications after this
period were published around the century border [4,5].
For supply the Berlin University with biological research materials
in 1891, the Zoological Station at Rovinj of Berlin Aquarium was
founded. That time got more overses publicity to the Adriatic, and
Naples institutions [6].
Because of having either sea, or fishery, with problems, it came up
a real need from the Hungarian side of the Monarchy, to base an own
station, but it was debated, not to set up it directly in Fiume, rather at
Cirkvenica, Porto-Ré, Martinschizza [7,8].
Due to mostly financial causes, finally the station was founded in
1905, under judistiction of the Maritime Authority in Fiume, as Fishing
Biological Station, under directorate of the famous Viktor Garády
Gauss, later teacher of the Naval Academy. Among other important
things, its duty was to supply the Hungarian research institutions with
marine materials (Figure 1).
Owing to the protectorate Maritime Authority, the station
immediately received a steam towing vessel, the “Klotild”, which was
exceptionally fit to carry out their duties (Figure 2) [9].
In some years, with the beginning of the regular deep-sea, and the
season scheduled researches around 1910 a new chapter begun on the
Adriatic. On Pentecost of 1910, in Venice, there was an ”International
Italian-Austrian Adria Research Committee” founded, which project
was helped by either 4 Italian, or 4 Austrian, warships, using quite
same methods, schedules, and instruments. The main warship from the
Italian side was the ”Ciclope”, from the Austrian side was the “Najade”
(Figure 3) [7,10,11].
During the research, they managed to get quite new knowledge
on the spreading of phytoplanktons, as Rhizosolenia, Chaetoarrus,
Ceratium. It was also examined the periodic spread and appearence of
Radiolaria, Pteropoda, Medusae, and determined the spread of eggs,
and seedlings of Sardinia pilchardus (Walbaum 1792), and Engraulis
encrasicolus (Linnaeus 1758). Meanwhile the Croatians also began
their own researches at the areas of the Quarnero, Quarnerolo. In the
research, the Croatian”Southern Slavic Academy” from Zagreb also
participated, on its way.
Despite the beginning of the international researches, Hungary’s
direct participation delayed a lot, than Hungary got invitation to the
international works, but surprisingly the international committee did
not put the Quarnero into the research programme.
In 1911 was formed another interesting initiative: a big project
was set up by the Prince Albert I of Monaco to run international
oceanographic research on the Mediterranean Sea. Hungary was also
invited, but nothing happened. As it was cleared, the invitations were
sent directly to the Hungarian Government, but they may have not had
personal interest to these projects. Austria had its own “Adria Verein”,
in Italy the project was managed by the “Comitato talassografico” so

Abstract
The aim of this article is, to acquaint you with a forgotten story of a country’s early oceanography activity, which
later lost its sea, and 2/3 area of its ground, but never lost the respect to the oceans life. During the time of the AutroHungarian
Monarchy (1867-1918) the oceanography have been developed in a short time in the Adriatic-Mediterranean
region, so there was need for stations to run scientific researches, and to have base stations for the expeditions. The
Hungarian scientists always had been among the firsts from the beginning, but they could get own station only in 1905
at Fiume. Before the breaking out of the WW-I they were able to run a lot of researches, and two famous Adriatic
expeditions.

the easiest way was to organize a Hungarian one. In 1910 was formed
the “Hungarian Adria Association”, then inside the “Marine Research
Committee” led by Béla Gonda, ministerial counsellor. The question was
solved, our Navy let the “Najade” use for the Hungarian Association,
either all of the Hungarian scientific institutions or the Austrian AdriaVerein
begun to help in equipping, and running of the expeditions.
In 1913-14 there were two Hungarian oceanographic expeditions
on the Adriatic with great results [11]. From the Hungarian side the
expeditions were led by Gyula Leidenfrost [12]. Among others, and
in the work of course, the son of the first Hungarian oceanographer,
Geza Entz Jun. Most of the affected species can be found in [7]. During
the war, Gast Reinhard, from the Institute was signed on as a fishing
biologist [7].
Newly Found Crustacea in the Adria Region
During the “Najad” expeditions, in 1912 they found new Crustacea
species at the deeper parts of the Adriatic, especially in the PelagosaGravosa
region. The new species belongs to the Eucyphidea group,
and Hoplophoridae family, named Acanthephyra purpurea multispina
Cout. In 1914, they managed to collect big, carmine coloured variations,
by using Petersen offspring trawl (Figure 4) [7].
The first known species of this group was the Acanthephyra
purpurea (A. Milne Edwards, 1881).
Epilog and New Way
Losing the seaside, after the WW I, the institute’s fish farming, and
oyster colonies were disappeared. It was a more than sad story, when
after moving the usable instruments from Rijeka to Rovinj, the new
Italian rulers physically liquidated the Hungarian institute’s aquariums
by hammers, and the former director just was present on these actions.
Anyway, the house was rebuilt to mariners barrack [12,13].
The Hungarian oceanography lost his direct contact with the sea,
but the work continued, all scientific participants of the sea researches
remained the esteemed members of the Hungarian scientific life.
