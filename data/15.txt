Abstract
A Myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) is a disorder characterized by active but ineffective hematopoiesis that
leads to pancytopenia. MDS, also termed as myeloid neoplasms, is described by different level of cytopenia that
is a different level of blood cells in the body. Various genes mutations have been reported to associate with MDS.
To investigate the mechanisms at molecular level underlying MDS patients carrying genetic mutations, the gene
expression profiles of MDS the patients were compared to that of healthy individuals and analyzed by bioinformatics
tools. In biological networks, genes having important functional roles can be identified by a measure of the node.
Networks of genes an in co-expression, candidate hubs also called extremely associated genes have been
connected with the key disease-related pathway. Thus, this technique was used to discover the MDS related genes
hub. Affymetrix Human Genome U133 plus 2.0 gene expression dataset of microarray GSE58831 was retrieved
from GEO (Gene Expression Omnibus) database that contained four 159 diseased samples and 17 samples of
control. Based on statistical method and co-expression networking, DEGs gene was detected. DAVID an online
tool was employed for Gene ontology (GO) function and KEGG pathway enrichment analysis of DEGs. Besides,
PPI (Protein-protein interaction) networks were developed by mapping the DEGs with respect to protein-protein
interaction set available in databases for the identification of the pathways involving DEGs. PPI interaction networks
were divided into subnetworks via MCODE algorithm and were examined by Cytoscape. Interferon Signaling
Pathway, cellular response to zinc ions and negative growth regulation. Immune response, negative regulation of
transcription from RNA polymerase II promotor, positive regulation of smooth muscle cell proliferation and cellular
response to Dexamethasone stimulus, extracellular matrix, extracellular space, and extracellular region were the
main enriched processes and pathways in these DEGs and many of the hub genes’ (UBC, TP53, EGFR, GADPH,
CREBBP, HDAC1, STAT1, IL6, ESR1, SMAD4) reported in this study were purposed as novel therapeutic targets
against MDS disease.

Introduction
A Myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), also known as preleukemia, is
a state of disease characterized by active but ineffective hematopoiesis
leading to pancytopenia [1]. Fatigue, breath shortness, paleness,
bleeding, and rashes are the general symptoms observed in patients
with MDS and also known as myeloid neoplasms, described by
different level of Cytopenia that is a different level of blood cells in
the body. Association of Cytopenia with dysplasia usually led to acute
myeloid leukemia. Epidemics of MDS are frequently reported in older
individuals [2,3]. Many factors have been reported as causes of MDS
including gene mutation that is broadly considered as a major factor
contributing to MDS. Gene mutations result in genotypic alteration and
thus, lead to cytogenetic shifts in gene expression. These cytogenetics
shifts are usually characterized by abnormal transcription of the gene,
epigenetic, cell signaling and effects of gene dosage. In addition, many
frequent cytogenetic aberrations were observed including a long
arm of chromosome 7, 20 and 5 that lead to a complex karyotype. In
MDS, most commonly mutated genes are of RNA splicing regulators
and epigenetic modifiers, along with pathways of signal transduction
and transcription factors have been frequently targeted towards this
syndrome [4-6]. MDS was reported to occur because of mutations
in different genes primarily includes SF3B1, SRSF2, ZRSR2, U2AF1,
DNMT3A, EZH2, TP53, RUNX1, and TET2. SF3B1 and demonstrated
independent expression with low mutation frequency, reduced
expression of TET2 in the stem and progenitor cells, and increased
DNA methylation activity in MDS [7]. Mutations in TET2 occurred
with same frequency in MDSs [8]. Different mutations were identified
but a mutation in SF3B1 gene was concluded as a most important factor.
MDS epidemics due to a mutation in SF3B1 gene contributed a total of
19.9% of all the reported cases. Patients with SF3B1 gene were usually
reported with more complications during the lifespan in comparison
to the patient with MDS due to other risk factors. SF3B1 gene was
also documented with mutations in a variety of other tumor types [9].
According to IPSS (International Prognostic Scoring System), MDS
was categorized in different risk groups, such as primary and secondary
MDS [10]. Abnormalities were observed like clonal karyotype that
formed nearly 40-50% of primary MDS and about 90% of secondary
MDS [11]. To date, no inclusive treatment other than Azacitidine,
Decitabine, and Lenalidomide is available in the markets and approved
by Food and Drug Administration of United States (US) for MDS.
However, allogenic therapy was reported as conclusive but currently,
less than 10% patients undergo such stem cell transplant [12]. Pellagatti
[13] detected several downregulated genes and gene pathways in MDS
using gene expression profiling [13-18]. Recently Gerstung et al. [19]

described a huge mutation in 738 patients with MDS and presented
a comprehensive map for the mutational landscape of myelodysplasia
screen in 111 cancer genes. Expression changes were typically lower
than 10% as a reoccurrence of mutation and could not be reliably
mapped in unknown and small subgroups. The genomics data reported
by Gerstung et al. [19] characterized the gene expression profiles of 159
MDS patients by comparing with 17 normal individuals to explore the
expression pattern of the genome in MDS affected individuals [19].
To date, the only agent with high efficacy such as Hypo ethylating
agent (HMA) has been employed for the treatment that improved
clinical outcomes in 40-60% of patient, however, no universal and
inclusive drugs are till date available against MDS. Therefore, we used
microarray gene expression data reported by Gerstung et al. [19] to
discover the potential drug targets. This study follows the statistical test
models along with genes enrichment and protein-protein interaction
analysis to identify the novel drug targets as a treatment for MDS.
This examination may facilitate and give a better understanding of the
detailed molecular mechanisms underlying MDS and thus, assist in the
selection of suitable and effective treatment strategies for patients with
MDS.
Methods
Microarray data
Gene expression profiling data of MDS was download from GEO
(Gene Expression Omnibus) [20] reported by Gerstung et al. [19],
under accession number GSE58831 [19]. This dataset was based on
Affymetrix Human Genome U133 plus 2.0 Array GPL570 platforms.
A total of 176 samples were reported in this dataset, that includes 17
normal candidates and remaining 159 candidates carried different
mutations for MDS. Quantile normalization [20] was carried out
to normalize the dataset via integrated GCRMA package of R v3.0.2
[21,22]. On the basis of Gerstung et al. [19] reported information, data
were divided into two groups as normal and diseased (Table 1).
Identification of DEGs
For the identification of differentially expressed genes, statistical
tools were applying to compare the normal samples with the diseased
samples to understand the molecular markers disturbed in MDS.
Student’s t-test, Pearson correlation test, and Benjamin-Hochberg
method were also applied for multiple testing via R v 3.0.2 as a
standardized method to identify the database of essential genes (DEGs).
The parameters were fixed for identification of these essential genes
contained Benjamin-Hochberg [22] multiple testing methods (FDR
<0.05) with fold-change = 1 and the adjusted p value <0.05.
Gene ontology and pathway enrichment analysis of DEGs
Gene ontology (GO) analysis such as GO Biological Processes,
Molecular Function and KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes
and Genomes) pathways analysis are the most common and useful
annotation of different Genes and its products. Attributes of high
throughput genomics and transcriptomic data could be obtained
through GO [23,24]. For the functional analysis, DAVID is an essential
and most frequent functioning online server which can functionally
annotate genes with high success [25]. Here, DAVID was used with a
P value <0.05 to annotate the functional role, KEGG pathways and GO
enrichment analysis of the identified DEGs [26].
PPI Network Generation
Cytoscape [13] is reliable software for the construction, mapping,
visualization, and analysis of protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks.
It works parallel with large databases which provides information
regarding protein-protein, protein-DNA, and genetic interactions.
STRING [27], BioGrid [28], GeneMANIA [29] for the retrieval of
protein interactions. In the present study, we used GeneMANIA,
STRING, and BioGrid to retrieve the interactions and construction
of Protein-protein interaction network for the identified DEGs. Many
topological parameters are available to analyze and compare the
network. Cytoscape is freely available software which also provides an
integrated function “Network Analyzer” to analyze the gene/protein
network. We also used “Network Analyzer” to calculate the parameters
for all the constructed networks. The primary parameters which were
analyzed include power law of node distribution, distribution of node
degree, clustering coefficient, network centralization and density to
distinguish the three constructed networks [30].
Hub Genes Identification and Molecular Complex
Detection Analysis of DEGs
A number of plugins are available for Cytoscape to perform different
analyses. Identifying hub genes which can be employed as probable
drug targets were identified using a well-known integrated plugin
Cytohubba [31]. Cytohubba provides the eleven methods of topological
analysis comprising degree, Edge Percolated Component, Maximum
Neighborhood Component, Density of Maximum Neighborhood
Component, Maximal Clique Centrality and six centralities (Bottleneck,
Eccentricity, Closeness, Radiality, Betweenness, and Stress) based on
shortest paths. It uses ranking features to rank different nodes in a
network and based on their values hub genes are reported. “Molecular
Complex Detection” (MCODE) is a novel clustering algorithm which
identifies sub-modules, as shown in Figure 1, in large PPI networks. It
allows fine-tuning of clusters of interest for protein networks. We used
MCODE [32] along with Cytohubba to identify the interconnected
dense sub-modules in the network. The hub genes and sub-modules
were subjected to enrichment analysis again for subsequent verification
using BinGO [33], an integrated app in Cytoscape.

and low connected genes.

Results
DEGs analysis and co-expression network
The complex biological system is composed of thousands of genes
and its products. Genes and respective products interacted randomly
and formed a more complicated network. The expression of these genes
and respective proteins performed and conveyed much information
such as signaling, transport, immunity, and defense and disease
susceptibility. Microarray expression analysis may pose many regular
variations. Herein, we used “Array Quality Metrics” and “GCRMA”
to perform the normalization. Comparing two types of datasets,
control and diseased, using statistical analysis; Student’s t-test, Pearson
correlation test and Benjamin-Hochberg methods, we identified a total
of 585 DEGs, wherein the 224 and 361 genes were recorded as Upregulator
and down-regulator genes, respectively.
GO function and KEGG pathway enrichment analysis
GO analysis approach is the easy and accessible approach for the
functional annotation of genomics data. Using DAVID database, we
explored the functional changes in a patient with MDS. GO enrichment
analysis was performed using the identified DEGs results into a diverse
array of processes and functions as shown in Table 2. Biological processes
of up regulated genes were mainly found in Interferon Signaling
Pathway, Cellular Response to Zinc Ions and negative regulation of
growth. Immune Response, negative regulation of transcription from
RNA polymerase II promotor, positive regulation of smooth muscle
cell proliferation and cellular response to Dexamethasone stimulus
were the enriched biological processes in down regulated DEGs.
While only molecular function in down regulated DEGs described
the transcriptional activator activity, RNA polymerase II core
promotor proximal region sequence-specific binding with FDR 0.04.
Furthermore, up regulated DEGs were found in extracellular matrix,
extracellular space, and extracellular region part. The analysis of KEGG
pathway enrichment revealed that down regulated DEGs were mainly
involved in only pathway primary for immunodeficiency while up
regulated genes were not enriched in any of KEGG pathways (Table 3).
Protein-Protein Interaction Network
A powerful tool to identify and understand the mechanism of
cellular networking is protein-protein interaction network. It provides
the basic understanding of both healthy and diseased conditions by
understanding the distortion in protein cellular network. Nodes are
proteins/genes while their interactions are edges in the protein-protein
interaction networks. Herein, DEGs obtained from the analysis of
microarray gene expression dataset of MDS were mapped and a protein
interaction network was constructed.
A total of 585 DEGs were mapped onto protein-protein interaction
network in Cytoscape. These DEGs were retrieved from available public
databases such as GeneMANIA, STRING, BioGrid and hub genes were
identified using a Cytoscape app, Cytohubba. Based on the degree of
connectivity between nodes and hub genes were identified as well as
ranked. The red nodes were highly connected nodes while the others
were low and medium. Cytohubba was used to calculate the degree of
each node in the network, that detected the hubs as nodes with degree
value >10 (Table 4). The complete DEGs network was divided into a
highly dense interconnected module using MCODE algorithm. A total
of 9 modules (Sub-networks were identified) using the k-core value of
2.0, node score cut-off of 0.2, maximum depth from the seed node of
100 and graphics processing-unit-based parallelization was employed
to find modules efficiently. Only sub-networks with a number of nodes
greater than 15 were selected (Figure 2). Finally, functional enrichment
of sub-networks was carried out. First, hub genes were checked in subnetworks
and presence of hub genes in the sub-networks revealed that
our results were reliable.
Figure 2: The depiction is illustrating the subnetworks identified in this study by
using MCODE algorithm.

Red nodes are highly connected genes, yellow and orange color are
medium and low connected genes. Subnetworks 1,2,3 and 4 were
enriched in GO terms related to chemical component extracellular
region part, extracellular matrix. Subnetworks 1 and 2 were enriched
in Immune response, Negative regulation of transcription from RNA
Polymerase II promotor. Subnetwork 3 and 4 were enriched in the
Positive regulation of smooth muscles cell proliferation, Cellular
response to Zinc ion. P-values of all the enriched GO terms were in the
range of 1.50E-07 to 8.78E-07 (Table 5 and Figure 1).

Discussion
Protein-protein interaction network has become a powerful tool for
identification of targets and analysis of different diseases. In the current
era, PPI network analysis has been widely utilized to understand the
mechanism of different diseases, identifying drug targets and metabolic
process. Analysis of gene expression dataset and identification of
differentially expressed genes in a disease condition compared to the
normal run a way of targeting different nodes for the discovery of novel
drug candidates. Here, we used microarray gene expression dataset
submitted to GEO under accession number GSE58831. Different
statistical tools were used such as, Student’s t-test, Pearson correlation,
and Benjamin Hochberg multiple testing method (FDR<0.05 with a
fold change>_1) and adjusted P-value 0.05) for the identification of
DEG, that result into a total of 585 differentially expressed genes, in
which 361 were downregulated and 224 were upregulated. Among
the downregulated genes, RAG1 (recombination activating gene
1) was found to be the most downregulated one with a -4.69-fold
change followed by MME (Membrane metallic-endopeptidase) and
ARPP21 (cAMP-regulated phosphoprotein 21) with 444 Fold change

Different bioinformatics tools were utilized to discover the hub
genes, enriched GO terms and KEGG pathways. GO terms related
to adhesion, signaling were the main terms enriched by DEGs. UBC,
TP53, EGFR, GADPH, CREBBP, HDAC1, STAT1, IL6, ESR1, and
SMAD4 were identified as possible potential genes targets for MDS
disease. However, further studies are required to determine the clinical
utility of these observations in the therapeutic management of MDS
related neurological disease.

2///hemoglobin subunit gamma 1) were the top with 265 Fold change
followed by 2.37 and 2.33 respectively. Upon subjection to enrichment
analysis, these DEGs revealed that they were involved in a diverse array
of processes. Among them, most enriched GO biological processes were
positive and negative of transcription from Immune response, Negative
regulation of transcription from RNA Polymerase II promotor, Positive
regulation of smooth muscles cell proliferation. Mapping of DEGs on
Cytoscape, top 10 hub genes were identified using Cytohubba. For
hub genes degree in Cytohubba was set as a parameter. Among the
top hub genes UBC with highest degree 234, TP53, EGFR, GADPH,
CREBBP, HDAC1, STAT1, IL6, ESR1 and SMAD4 with a degree
130,108,86,82,76,66,64,61 and 57 respectively. These hub genes were
also found in sub-networks as shown in the table as a way of validating
out the result.
The enrichment of hub genes given in Table 4 reports the same
category of processes and thus validated our results. The Ubiquitin
C (UBC) and Tumor protein (TP53) were found as “super hubs”
genes. Zhang et al. [33] reported the Tumor protein 53(TP53) genes
mutations occurring in patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS)
which was associated with abnormalities like a high risk of karyotype
including 17p and complex cytogenetics. The existence of TP53
mutations in 17% of MDS was isolated with del(5q). TP53 was reported
as a most frequently mutated gene with a complex karyotype [34,35].
Signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 play a vital role in
body’s immune response. Herold et al. [36] reported that interleukin6(IL-6)
exerts positive effect and played a great role in infections,
inflammations and possible involvement in leukemogenesis. Mothers
against decapentaplegic homolog 4(SMAD4) gene was an important
element of tumor suppressor as reported by Dolatshad et al. [36] that
also showed differential Exon usage overlapping with other gene. Li et
al. [37] documented the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene
represent somewhat the malignant proliferation and suppress apoptosis
through an unknown mechanism in MDs because it overexpressed in
most cases [37]. Furthermore, our finding revealed that a number of
Hub genes were associated with proteins because they disturbed the
progression and development of MDS, and provided the important
route towards therapeutics development against MDS [38].
Conclusion
To examine the relationships between the importance of genes
and several topological characteristics in human PPI network, system
biology approach was used in the present study. There are several
previously reported works with mutations and pathways associated
with different gene mutation and pathways involved in its pathogenesis.
Because of this, gene expression data of MDS patients and Healthy
individual’s samples were used to identify the DEGs relation to MDS.
