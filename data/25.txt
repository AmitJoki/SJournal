Abstract
The micronutrient selenium (Se) is an important trace and building block element for humans as well as for
other mammals. It is ubiquitous in soil but its supply to plants is limited due to its insoluble form high-iron, low-pH
and leached soil. Thus, it leads limited supply of micronutrients from plant to animal and then to human consumer
and in low concentration in regard to standard health requirements. Such type of flow causes deficiency of Se
and enhances different types of diseases threats such as; cancer, heart diseases, many inflammatory conditions,
thyroid dysfunction. Billion individuals are affected by Se deficiency worldwide. It demands the question of discovery
different types of strategies to enhance the Se intake. The most common cereal crop is wheat which is used as staple
food in many countries. The major cause of Se deficiency is Intake of low-Se based wheat. Enhancement of Se in
wheat through biofortification methods seems a good strategies for enhancement of Se in wheat and overcome the
Se deficiency in plants and ultimately in human and other mammals. In this study, we reviewed different strategies
that can be used to improve the Se contents in wheat through biofortification.

Introduction
Selenium is an important trace mineral and element of Mammalian.
Although, body require this trace element in small amount but is a basic
constituent of diet [1] i.e. it must be taken up by the body from the food
it gets. It has great importance in human survival as it is involved in
important biochemical processes going on in a body. It plays an important
role in structural component of Selenoprotiens and enzymatic for the
production of active thyroid hormone, which acts as an antioxidant
and catalyst. It acts as a counteracting agent against the development
of virulence and inhibits the growth of HIV [2-5]. Different research
has indicated that it is important and key nutrient required by immune
system. It also helps in sperm movement and decrease the probability
of miscarriages. Selenium also helps in production of special proteins
called antioxidant enzyme [6], which restricted cell damaging and
protect the body after vaccination, like already mentioned it is required
by the immune system. Some of the research shows its importance in
preventing cancer and cardiovascular disease but no evidence has come
so far. Moreover it protects the body against the toxic effects of the heavy
metal or harmful substances.
Deficiency of Se
Deficiency of Se can cause severe and adverse effects on the body.
Relationship between selenium deficiency and cardiovascular disease
risk is still undiscovered but in other cases elevate level of Se lead
oxidative stress and inflammation. The intake of selenium rich food
required by the body reduces the level of cancer causing. These are
being tested on large clinical trials which are held for the verification of
research of research results [4].
There are different factors that cause Selenium deficiency and one
of the most important is intake of food low concentration of selenium
mineral, or long term feeding on vein can also cause Se deficiency.
Se deficiency can also lead Keshan Disease in which abnormal heart
muscles develop and it was the major reason of China children death.
As a mineral source it also cause another disease named as Kashin-Beck
Disease which is a joint and bone disease [7]. Myxedematous Endemic
Cretinisim, cause intellectual disability. When body fails to absorb
selenium gastrointestinal disorders occur which ultimate lead to Crohn’s
Disease. Selenosis is malnutrition of selenium in the blood which causes
hair loss, nail deforming, mild nerve damage etc.
Source of Se
Plants grown in rich selenium soil are the best source of selenium
diet. It all depends on the type of soil where the plantation was carried
that how much selenium concentration is present in the soil is to be
obtained. Food like fish, shellfish, red meat, serials, grains, and livestock
can be good source of selenium. Brewer’s Yeast and wheat are always a
healthy source of selenium diet. Below is a table showing the Se content
in northeast and southwest region of China (Table 1).

It has been proved by many scientists that selenate is much more
effective as compare to selenite when these are applied directly to soil
or as foliar in fertilizers [25-30]. For example, when selenate applied to
the soil in 10 g/ha the hardly illustrates grain content of 100 µg/kg, but
to attain this much of grain content with the selenite 110 g/ha was to
be applied [27]. Furthermore a study demonstrated the elevate level of
selenate over the sandy clay formed considerably enhanced results on
grain content in barely by increasing the amount from 33 µg/kg to 234
µg/kg, whereas selenite didn’t demonstrate any change [29]. It might be
due to the property of selenite colliding with soil and become limiting
factor for plants. Some parameters should be taken under consideration
which is the application of Se form e.g the time of foliar application and
the characteristic of soil. The major cause of UK low Se diet is wheat low
in Se residues. A study was performed to increase the high yield of UK
wheat crop by using fertilizers. In this experiment two methods were
used: one was the adding of selenate with sodium as a solution while
the other was as granular Se-containing products. This explained that
grain content were increased by 16–26 ng Se g/ha fresh weight (FW)
applied this conclude that 10 g/ha Se addition may raise the 10-fold of
the Se concentration in the UK wheat and confirmed that the agronomic
biofortification of wheat is reasonable. In addition it showed the increase
of 20-35% in total recovery (grain and straw).
A study was also conducted on Maize to check against the uptake
of Se. in this experiment three types of Se fertilizers were used which
were liquid drench of Na2SeO4 (aq) (0–100 g Se ha-1), a compound
NPK + Se fertilizer (0–6 g Se ha-1), or Se-enriched calcium ammonium
nitrate (CAN + Se; 0–20 g Se ha-1). At the end result was same for all of
the forms of fertilizer plus the application rate. Mean of experimental
values were taken and showed 20, 21 and 15 µg Se/kg for each gram of
Se applied as Na2SeO4(aq), NPK + Se and CAN + Se, correspondingly.
This can initiate the Se intake by human population by 26–37 µg Se
person/d by adding 5g of Se/ha according to the pattern developed by
national maize consumption in Malawi predominantly [31].
In South Australia the research done on wheat demonstrated
progressive uptake of Se by the wheat crop when introduce to soil
directly or by foliar application. The increase Se concentration was
observed by 20- to 133-fold for soil and foliar by 6- to 20-fold, the
maximum of which grain Se concentration of 12 mg kg-1 was obtained.
When 4-120 g of Se/ha was applied there wasn’t any effect on grain yield
or protein content. Se with Na solution is an inexpensive and more
reliable fertilization method which maintains Se level in body decrease
the risk of developing cancer [11].
Brassica species is an efficient way for accumulation of Se and it can
be used for the biortification of Se to fulfill the deficiency and gap in
the food chain. To confirm this a study was carried out in the species of
Brassica i.e. B. rapa and B. napus in field experiment which were applied
by 0, 6 or 20 mg Se ha-1 as Na2
SeO4
 and foliar sprays of 30 mgSe/ha
as Na2
SeO4
 or Na2
SeO4
. The results were Se concentration (1.89 µg/g)
and (1.34 µg/g) after oil extraction fraction. It concludes that foliar spray
is more effective and efficient. Studies exposed that 68-75% of Se was
present in a useful content which is selenomethionine (SeMet). Brassica
plants at rosette stage had taken up 30-40%, but the translocation to seeds
was low. The experiment illustrated that agronomic bio-fortification of
Brassica can also help in decrease the deficiency of Se.
Brazil lacks information on Se in agricultural crops. Though there is
sign that low levels of Se are consumed by the population. The research
was carried out under greenhouse conditions and have pots containing
3l of nutritive solution in a completely randomized factorial design, with
seven Se concentrations : 0, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, and 64 µmol/l and two forms
kg while in seleniferous areas can go up to 10 mg/kg [8]. Now a day
biologists take more interest in micronutrients as it has found to be a vital
micronutrient and is significant for many of the organisms including
humans, animals and higher plants [9-11]. Selenium deficiency and
toxicity both are of great importance for humans and animals, as it can
be lethal in some cases of Keshan’s Disease.
How plants take up selenium?
Selenium is present as a predominant state Selenate in well oxidized
and alkaline soil while in more acidic and well drained soils this is present
as selenite [12]. As a result of Selenite and sulfate similar chemical
properties, Selenite is taken up by the sulfate transporters [13]. The
picking up of selenite by the plants depends upon the health, nutrition
factors and external concentration of both the sulfate and selenate. Higher
the sulfate content more will be the selenate uptake and vice versa [14].
But this condition may change from plant to plant and even transport
system. There are plants which very Se accumulation in plants differs from
between species or even within the species. Accumulation of Se in high
amount is known as hyper accumulation. Statistics reveal that this can
vary from 1000-10,000 µg/kg dry weight where as other accumulates it
like <20 mg/kg. Se accumulation not depend only structure and seasonal
changes of plant but also depends on its movement from shoot to root
during fall and from older to younger leaves and reproductive organs in
summers [15]. Furthermore Se hyper-accumulator or non-accumulator
doesn’t illustrate any considerable difference when grown in the same
field. As far as these crop plants are concerned a variety of differences in
the accumulation of Se have been reported. Any significant amount of
Se concentration has not shown in wild wheat or wheat landraces grain
while diploid wheat grains do [11]. In plants bioavailability of Se may
be a factor which controls the movement of Se uptake [16]. Genotypic
variation might become prominent if there is high Se concentration. The
research on 14 hard red winter wheat species discovered this hypothesis,
and the environmental factors can also be the restrictive factors [17]. This
has been recognized so frequently that inter or intra specie deviations for
Se accumulation exists but fact is that genetics of Se accumulation have
hardly ever been investigated. However recombinant interbred has shown
the genetic basis of selenate tolerance A. thaliana which reveals 3 QTLs
(quantitative trait loci) on chromosome no. 1, 3 and 5. This can elucidate
about the 24% of the variation with reference to the tolerance index
defined by root-length inhibition and 32% of the root length in terms of
the phenotypic deviation [18].
To overcome Se scarcity the farmers use algorithmic bio-fortification
which is the addition of bioavailable Se in fertilizers. This also has been
experienced different types of crops and in many countries [19-22]. As
for as inter and intra-specific variation is concerned these can be explored
and then bio-fortified (genetic bio-fortification) [23]. Scientists and
farmers are trying to enhance Se quantity in crop by adding Se fertilizers
to overcome the world problem of fighting against Se deficiency. To put
selenium into the soil is a cheap and of low cost method which can be
taken up by plants and so the humans later. The costs for mechanically
adding the Se to soil is about US$1.00/ha. It was demonstrated by the
high level blood Se in the Finland post 1983. Experimentation also
shows the high bioavailability of Se to wheat Se fertilized is as compare
to American wheat, was naturally high in Se concentration. The trialing
in Finland also illustrate the considerable result of Se uptake by wheat by
soil application or foliar which were elevate from 0.1 mg/kg to 0.25 mg/
kg. Now Se in range of 5-10 g/ha is applied which is safe and is readily
absorbed. Se fertilization has been accomplished for over 30 years but
no Se build-up has occurred, and positive response continues to be
attaining from Se application [24].

, with six
replicates. The application of Se as selenate at low concentrations is
more appropriate for lettuce bio-fortification because it helps in shoot
biomass growth and level of Se in the shoot biomass. In both forms Se
had two effects on lettuce plant metabolism: it acted as an antioxidant
at low concentration and improved plant growth while on other hand at
higher levels it reduced yield [6].
Conclusion
It is evident that wheat biofortified with Se is a safe and bioavailable
source of organic Se and is recommendable for human consumption.
Furthermore, biofortifcation appears to be preferable to process
fortification with regard to prevention of Se-met oxidation during
high temperature processing of wheat into puffed wheat biscuits. In
conclusion biofortified wheat is a suitable food for improving selenium
status in humans. However, further research is needed to verify its
bioefficacy in selenium-deficient populations.
