Abstract
Until recently, the complexities of biological processes and systems have emphasized classifications and
empirical rules, that have lacked explanatory power and been limited by many exceptions. On the other hand,
modern physics and quantum physics in particular, has a universal capacity to explain physical interactions down to
the subatomic scale, including biological processes and systems. The scientific field of biology has succeeded over
the past decades in explaining macroscopic phenomena that are based on an improved understanding of molecular
structures and behaviours. Likewise, quantum physics has provided a non-classical approach to unintuitive
characteristics, and has recently been directed towards systems of increasing complexity. With the rise of high
performance computing, the field of quantum biology has rapidly developed in recent years to challenge us to
rethink biological processes such as the magnetoreception of Earth’s magnetic field that allows birds to migrate, how
enzymes are able to accelerate reactions at astonishing speeds, and why photosynthesis in plants is near to 100%
efficient. Even biology’s primary conceptual basis, namely Charles Darwin’s and Alfred Wallace’s theory of evolution
by natural selection, is now thought to be influenced by the esoteric but fundamental laws of quantum mechanics.
This article will act as a guide to explain such phenomena, explore the growing interconnectedness between the two
scientific fields and question the future possibilities of quantum biology.

Introduction
Why grass is green and blood is red: using quantum phenomena to
explain biological systems.
?is essay explores the emerging new field of quantum biology, in
which biological systems can be explained at a fundamental level using
quantum physics. In 1612, Donne wrote an elegy that was from the
realm of abstract metaphysics in which he stated, ‘Why grass is green,
or why our blood is red, are mysteries which none have reached unto’
[1]. He and others of that time period believed that there was no need
for the inquisitive rational of science, or the natural curiosity that
comes with being human. However much has changed in the last four
hundred years. ?e interdisciplinary research from biologists and
chemists has been able to explain that iron-based pigments with the
ability to carry oxygen are at the center of haem chains in red blood
cells [2]. Similarly, physicists also contributed to our understanding of
the chlorophyll-containing mesophyll cells in plants. ?e colours
expressed are explained with a combination of classical and modern
physics. ?e energies absorbed and emitted, in both plant chlorophyll
and blood haemoglobin molecules, by the quantum jumping of
electrons, are the same as that which reflect green and red, respectively.
Quantum mechanics has long been known to play a crucial role in
the world of chemistry and in turn, chemistry has been able to set the
structured, predictable rules for biological systems (Figure 1). However,
in the book ‘What is Life?’ Schrödinger questioned how an event at the
atomic scale, a mutation in the molecular structure of a gene for
example, whilst being governed by the laws of quantum mechanics,
could cause a profound and visible change in the structure of a living
organism [3].
Figure 1: Quantum biology encompasses quantum mechanics to
explain biological systems.
How can organisms undergo metamorphosis at such a rate that
statistics and classical physics cannot explain? How is it possible that
nearly all of photons energy can reach a leaf ’s reaction center without
being reflected, absorbed or redirected? Seventy years since
Schrödinger’s book was published, scientific understanding has grown
at an impressive and exponential rate; however questions like this are
still di?cult to approach.

Figure 2: As lower levels are reached; atoms and subatomic particles
are observed. ?eir relationships and behaviors are explained with
quantum mechanics and lead to the many reactions seen in
biological systems.
?e e??ects of quantum mechanics can of course be observed, but
usually only under extremely rigid conditions such as temperatures
near absolute zero and under the influence of vacuums (Figure 2) [4].
Even then, researchers can only use simple particles on a very small
scale to observe the complex e??ects of coherence [5]. Up until the late
1980’s, most scientists would agree that quantum mechanics played a
trivial, if any, role in biological processes [6,7].
Quantum Tunnelling
?H Sun
?e energy provided from the Sun drives life on Earth, from
metabolic reactions to reproducing behaviors. In order to supply this
energy though, the Sun performs special types of reactions – fusion
reactions. ?e sample hydrogen particles in the Sun fuse together to
form helium and other heavier elements, releasing huge quantities of
energy as a result. Essentially, the Sun is converting its mass into
energy.
Since the 1920’s, we have been researching and attempting to
replicate the process of nuclear fusion, in order to harness the large
amounts of energy for a variety of purposes. However, one of the main
limitations on researching this nuclear process on Earth is achieving
the required temperature needed for fusion to occur. ?e core of the
Sun is estimated to be 15.6 million Kelvin and therein lays the
problem. Researchers cannot e??ectively replicate these temperatures,
so the search is focused on low-energy fusion reactions.
Figure 3: An electron does not have the required energy to get over
the barrier to start a reaction. ?ere is a small probability that it can
tunnel through the barrier though and the reaction takes place as a
result. ?is is how nuclear fusion works in the Sun, driving life on
Earth [8].
As the hydrogen particles increase in temperature, there is a small
chance that the hydrogen atoms will fuse together, even if the correct
temperature has not been reached yet. ?is e??ect was mathematically
introduced in 1928 by Hu?auer [9]. Balantekin and Takigawa
demonstrated that rather than waiting for the required temperature
needed to overcome the energy barrier that starts the fusion reaction,
the electron in the hydrogen atom ‘tunnels’ through the barrier instead
(Figure 3) [10].
?e significance of this process is twofold. Firstly, our main source
of heat and catalyst of many biological reactions relies on quantum
mechanics to provide the sheer amount of energy required to drive
biology processes on Earth. And secondly, if a structure as important
and relatively simple as the Sun can use quantum forces, surely the
incredibly complex and high number of processes that occur in
biological systems, have undiscovered quantum connections.
Enzyme catalysis
?e fastest studied reactions in the history of science include those
in biological systems that are caused by proteins called enzymes. An
appreciation of the sheer speed and rate of these reactions is yet to be
completely realised by researchers but one thing is absolutely clear. In
the absence of enzymes, these same reactions are among the slowest
that have ever been measured, some with half-times approaching the
age of the Earth [11]. $?er a substrate is bound at an enzyme’s active
site (forming an enzyme-substrate complex), its half-life is usually a
small fraction of a second (Figure 4) [12].
Figure 4: Lowering of reaction’s activation energy caused by an
enzyme-substrate complex. Also simulating a visual of the e??ects of
quantum tunnelling on enzyme catalysis [13].
Back in 60s, it was discovered that quantum tunnelling also takes
place inside living cells [14]. Amphibians, such as frogs, use quantum
tunnelling to undergo the biological process of metamorphosis –
where the tadpole breaks down and reassembles as a frog [15]. ?e
speed at which this process occurs cannot be adequately explained by
traditional methods of thinking. ?e tail is remarkably broken down
into the basic units of life, and is redistributed in the newly forming
frog as proteins, such as enzymes and collagen (a protein that supports
the muscles, tendons and ligaments within living organisms and has
elastic properties).
?e strong bonds between proteins are very di?cult to separate and
should last much longer than the tadpoles lifespan [16,17]. Enzymes
are responsible for breaking these bonds at an accelerated rate. ?e
spontaneous rates of biological reactions examined in this way, span a

range of more than sixteen orders of magnitude (Figure 5), with halflives
ranging from five seconds, for the hydration of CO2
 to 1.1 billion
years, for the decarboxylation of amino acids [18,19]
Figure 5: Natural half-times of some biological reactions in neutral
solution at 25°C [20].
?is incredible acceleration has been the subject of discussion and
debate for nearly thirty years now and a leading theory has peaked the
interests of physics and biologists alike. A group of scientists found that
enzymes are able to transfer subatomic particles, like electrons and
protons, from one part of a molecule to another, via quantum
tunnelling [21]. It's an e?cient theory and explains how the proton
tunnelling to another location will cause the strong bonds to become
weak bonds in a fraction of a second (Figure 6).
?e protons do not have to overcome the energy barrier, but can
tunnel through it (similar to tunnelling within the Sun), in order to
break the chemical bonds. As subatomic particles are not solid, that
can exhibit wave-like behaviours, allowing them to approach a barrier
from one side and they have a certain probability of reappearing
instantaneously on the other.
Figure 6: (A) Shows a simple but e??ective square knot at the top and
the bottom shows a similar tie but will never join the two pieces of
rope. ?is demonstrates the quantum e??ect of tunnelling in where,
in this case, there are two possible outcomes–a strong bond and a
weak bond. (B) Shows a digitally altered image where one of the
ends of rope (the proton) on top is ‘tunnelling’ to a new position.
(C) Illustrates the new position and now has e??ectively caused the
bond to break. ?is could be demonstrated by a person pulling at
any end on any rope in image (C). It would instantly come undone.
In metamorphosis, the collagen proteins in the tadpole tail are
quickly broken down and other enzymes are then able to redistribute
the particles to form the frog. However, some researchers are yet to be
convinced that enzymes are doing anything special and that their own
results suggest that “tunnelling is a fact of life, but life has no special
e??ect on tunnelling” [22].
Contrasting such statements, with near overwhelming evidence, it is
theorized that enzymes can use their dynamic behaviour to force
protons through the energy barrier, a characteristic unique to these
powerhouse proteins. Evidence is even beginning to emerge that such
behaviours are selected by evolution to enhance enzyme catalysis [23].
Future research will provide intellectually provocative models of
enzyme catalysis and suggest new avenues for experimental and
computational investigations.
Quantum Entanglement
Migration by magnetoreception
?e European robin (Erithacus rubecula) migrates from
Scandinavia down to the Mediterranean, every autumn (Figure
7). Whilst migratory patterns with birds caused by seasonal changes is
not a new phenomenon, what is special and worth investigating, is how
they manage to travel to the exact same geographical areas each year.
?ese areas are the same locations that their predecessors emigrated to
and, hence, human curiosity has long wondered, how do organisms
know exactly where they are going, particularly if they have never been
there before? How can birds navigate with such accuracy? Is it a
magnetic particle within them that responds to Earth’s magnetic field"
Is it a behavioural trait passed from one generation to the next? Or is it
something smaller than a gene and much more complicated?
Figure 7: ?e European robin, and like a lot of other marine animals
and even insects, navigate by sensing the Earth's magnetic field
[24].
?ese hypotheses were experimentally tested in a repurposed
planetarium (Figure 8); using specialised Emlen funnels which are
round cages in the shape of funnels lined with scratch sensitive paper
and an inkpad on the bottom, shown in Figure 9 [25].
At night, with the artificial magnetic field inactive, the caged
migrant birds became restless and jumped more o?en in the direction
where they intend to migrate, making ink prints on the scratch
sensitive paper. However, what was even more astounding was that if
the wavelength of light was changed, the behaviour of the robins
changed and instead of moving in the direction of expected migration,
their movements became random and they jumped in a variety of
directions, as seen in Figure 10. It seemed that monochromatic blue
light (the predominant wavelength of light at night) enhanced the
robin’s orienteering ability.

planetarium [26].
Figure 9: An Emlen funnel, used to document migration orientation
in bird.
Figure 10: Experiments show birds exposed to monochromatic light
exhibit di??ering orientating behaviour – orientation is better in
‘blue’ light [27].
?e caged robins also changed their heading accordingly when the
magnetic field was artificially altered using strong magnets, with
variable directions being applied. ?is meant that when the magnetic
field was active in a particular direction, the robin moved in the same
direction. If living systems are sensitive to the magnetic vector
potential component of the geomagnetic field, which is directed EastWest,
this mean that they must have both X and Y coordinates
available. ?is posed an interesting dilemma, was the underlying cause
of this behaviour due to wavelengths of light or a varying magnetic
field, like Earth’s?
A researcher struggled for years to narrow down the possible
reasons that would explain such behaviour. Eventually he developed
leather hoods (Figure 11) with removable eye patches which were able
to cover one eye of the robin at a time during the experiments. It was
found that photons excited a particular protein molecule,
cryptochrome, in the retinal cells of the right eye and causing an
electron from a particular particle to move to another. ?is means both
molecules are now charged, that is to say one molecule is positive and
one is negative[28]. ?e incoherent part of this anomalyis that these
molecules are both positive and negative at the same time. ?ey exhibit
behaviours of both charges until one is measured, and, hence, the other
particle when measured will be the opposite charge, due to the Pauli
exclusion principle [29]. ?ese particles are now in a state of quantum
entanglement where they are correlated with each other, but they lose
their individuality [30].
?e infamous example of Schrodinger’s Cat helps explain this
unusual concept. If you were to place a cat into a box containing a
randomly-released lethal gas and sealed the box up, the cat itself could
be thought of as both dead and alive, by an external observer [31]. ?e
charged particles mentioned above, exhibit such behaviours and hence
can be thought of in the same way as Schrodinger’s Cat.
Entangled particles are extremely sensitive to magnetic fields. ?eir
interactions, caused by the angle of inclination of the magnetic field,
trigger action potentials and the subsequent chemical reactions act as
sensory chemicals which tell the robin which way to go [31]. ?e
entangled pair induces di??erent chemical reactions based on their
relationship and quantum state (orientation of spin). ?e tiny
variations in Earth’s magnetic field can alter the state of these
entangled electrons and hence a??ect the robin’s ability to sense its
orientation. Even Einstein hated this idea; he called it "spooky action at
a distance” as entanglement implied that the relationships between
particles occurred faster than the speed of light, impossibility in
Einstein’s theory of relatively.
Figure 11: ?e leather hood used to cover the right eye of a
European robin – the source of cryptochrome and the inclination
compass used for migratory orientation [32].
?e implications of research could be ground breaking. Many
organisms use cryptochrome as a photoreceptor so this quantumassisted
magnetic sensing, could be widespread. Not only birds, but
also some insects and even plants show physiological responses to
magnetic fields. An example includes the growth-inhibiting influence
of blue light on the flowering plant Arabidopsis thaliana and it is
moderated by magnetic fields [33].
Quantum Coherence
Photosynthesis
In the cases of the avian compass described above, the primary
evidence for quantum processes is observation of animal behaviour,
combined with a lack of plausible classical models. However, by
contrast, evidence for quantum influences in the biological process of
photosynthesis is direct, measurable and overwhelming.
Quantum coherence is the idea of quantum entities multitasking. It
can be represented by the quantum skier from Figure 12 where an
object behaves like a wave so it doesn't just move in one direction or
the other, but can follow multiple pathways at the same time.

Figure 12: ?e quantum skier counter intuitively exhibits a
behaviour of being able to follow several paths at once and ‘finds’
the most e?cient one to perform its designated process [34] .
A light harvesting, photosynthetic system uses ‘antenna’ molecules
called chlorophyll inside chloroplasts, to capture photons, the quantum
of light (sunlight energy). ?is capturing of photons knocks out an
electron from the chlorophyll molecule and creating a quantum
particle called an exciton.
?e exciton travels through surrounding chlorophyll molecules,
until it reaches the reaction centre and ultimately results in the
production of Adenosine trisphosphate (ATP), the ‘molecule of life’ via
aerobic cellular respiration.
For maximum e?ciency, all photons absorbed have to make it to
the reaction centre, but there are so many random paths and the
photon does not ‘know’ the most e?cient route [35]. If the exciton
doesn’t reach the reaction centre fast enough, the energy will dissipate
into the system. So how then can the process of light-harvesting, by
nearly 100% e?cient"
Figure 13: ?e coherence of quantum particles allows the wave-like
properties to be examined and the most e?cient path of the photon
energy (via the exciton) will be the result [40].
?e evidence from multiple, independent studies, is that rather than
taking one path, quantum coherence is used to travel all paths
simultaneously as shown in Figure 13 [36-39].
?erefore, there is plenty of evidence that can demonstrate that the
interplay between quantum coherence and the performance of biomolecular
complexes. ?is can be intuitively explained by the fact that
quantum coherence allows the system to explore several network paths
in parallel to achieve the desired task to find the optimal solution and
leave out ine?cient slower pathways [41].
Quantum Biology: ?H Future
?H theory of evolution – Quantum edition
?e final question that this paper will explore is whether quantum
tunnelling plays a non-trivial role in mutations in DNA. It has been
well established that variations (mutations) within species drives
evolution [42].
DNA is comprised of complementary nitrogenous bases (adenine
and thymine, cytosine and guanine) and during the cell cycle, the
majority of time is spent in a stage called interphase [43]. ?is is where
the cell performs its normal functions including the process of DNA
replication. Essentially, this is how one strand of DNA is replicated to
form 2 identical strands for the purpose of cell division (mitosis or
meiosis).
?e two strands of DNA found in a double-helix structure, are held
together by these nitrogenous bases; like a twisted ladder [44]. ?ese
bases are bound together by relatively weak hydrogen bonds (protons).
?e process of DNA replication is always proofed and checked for
errors by an enzyme named DNA polymerase which can repair most
mutations; however polymerase still has its limitations [45]. Sometimes
in the process, mistakes can occur and these mistakes are called genetic
mutations.
Figure 14: ?e white atoms are hydrogen and protons from the
hydrogen atoms can “jump” across to the other side via quantum
tunnelling. If the strands of DNA are separated by DNA replication
or protein synthesis, while the hydrogen has jumped across to the
opposite side, these strands may not replicate or transcribe
correctly–this is a mutation [46].
?is movement can be explained by the process of quantum
tunnelling [47]. When replication is initiated by an enzyme called
DNA helicase, which splits hydrogen bonds [48]. ?e two white balls
in the middle of Figure 14 are protons, one proton prefers to sit on one
strand; the other, on the other strand.
?ey have ability to tunnel through the bonds to the other side. If
the two strands of DNA then separate for replication to occur, and the
two protons are in the wrong positions, this could ultimately lead to a
mistake known as a mutation(Figure 15).

Figure 15: DNA mutates when this hydrogen atom tunnels,
quantum-mechanically, to the “wrong” half of its rung. ?e
property of coherence, before it is observed, the atom will
simultaneously exist in both a mutated and non-mutated state-that
is, it would sit on both sides of the rung at the same time [49].
?is concept has been examined using bacteria. A population of
bacteria (E. coli) with hydrogen nuclei was cultured and the mutations
in the produced cells were quantified. At the same time, a separate
population was cultured, but these had deuterium nuclei (deuterons), a
heavier isotope of hydrogen [50]. ?e results of these experiments
showed that the protons within hydrogen nuclei were able to tunnel
easily and thus led to many mutations. However, the population
containing deuterons did not produce many mutations. ?is is because
deuterons are twice as heavy as the hydrogen nuclei and therefore are
increasingly di?cult to tunnel through energy barriers.
?e concept of quantum mechanics playing a non-trivial role in
DNA mutations is still heavily debated today, predominated because
the concentrated deuterium oxide will not take a frequency imprint
until about 4% of hydrogen oxide is added. ?is suggests that there are
‘windows’ of opportunity in which biological systems are sensitive to
the electro quantum environment, leading to a possible eventuality of
changes in the genetic information carried by individual organisms.
Current research certainly allows for quantum tunnelling to be a
plausible mechanism for variations to occur and hence have the
opportunity to be naturally selected to survive in certain conditions.
It’s even speculated that through the process of quantum coherence,
living cells act as biological quantum computers and are able to explore
multiple possible mutational states simultaneously, and select those
states that provide the greatest advantage – ?e ?eory of Evolution
redefined as a construct of quantum mechanics.
Approaching an era of quantum technologies
Quantum coherence or superposition is an extremely e?cient
energy transportation system. ?e photosynthesis example discussed
above demonstrated that particles can travel faster along the
photosynthetic complex due to the fact that it can exist in two states
simultaneously. Researchers from the PAPET’s group shot fast laser
pulses into biological systems and observed interference along the
transport network, a signature of wavelike phenomena. As a result, we
are able to obtain a more fundamental understanding of how
photosynthesis works. And can guide future research towards
designing much more e?cient solar cells than the ones we currently
have [50]. However, they do outline that one of the biggest obstacles in
designing complex organic solar cells, is the di?culty to control what
happens a?er light is absorbed. ?e characteristics that would be most
valuable and beneficial include the transmission of energy, storing
information or emitting light [51].
An extended application of solar-cells is the development of bioinspired
sensors. Developing sensors that interpret desired signals
whilst ignoring complex background influences, as well as lightweight,
a??ordable and retain their sensitivity is particularly di?cult [52].
Nature is an extraordinary test bed for biological systems as they’ve
been exposed to billions of years of evolution and can e?ciently use
quantum mechanics to their advantage. Exploring magnetic
navigation, Quantum (??ects in Biological Environments (QuBE)
researchers from the Defence Advanced Research Projects Agency
(DARPA) are also studying photosynthesis, olfaction and the
underlying theoretical framework needed to link biology and quantum
phenomena [53].
Another area of potential application is in quantum computing [54].
Quantum data (qubits) can exist in both states at once, thus permitting
the simultaneous exploration of all possible answers to the
computation that they encode, similar to the quantum coherence
within a photosystem, performing a ‘best-path’ quantum computation,
or the mutated state of DNA. It has been shown through studying how
water can embed or imprint frequencies that the 3 basic logic gates
needed for biological quantum computers to operate, can be assembled
and maintained in water. Even with such advancements, research still
goes on to suggest that these gates are so sensitive that they can be
detected and measured using nerve impulses. Quantum simulation has
potential applications for the study of condensed matter physics,
material science, and high-energy physics [55-57].
Conclusion
If the question is put forth, do quantum mechanics play a significant
role in biological systems? ?e answer is most definitely yes. Our Sun
employs quantum tunnelling to transform hydrogen to helium which
in turn releasing heat and light energy. ?is e??ect alone allowed Earth
able to become habitable. ?e evolution of photosynthetic organisms
utilized the Sun’s energy and transformed the Earth from anoxic to
oxic. Every organism, since this epic event in our history has evolved as
a direct result of quantum influences.
?e design of experiments that directly test hypotheses here, at the
quantum level, must be a priority for advancement. Much of quantum
biology remains as conjecture because of the amount of restrictions
and environmental controls needed to observe even the simplest
quantum e??ect. Any analysis of such data in relation to biological
systems is redundant without experimental proof from complex living
organisms. At this stage, there is too much conflict within data to
suggest quantum mechanics can explain all biological systems.
However, there is enough evidence to suggest an undeniable
plausibility. ?e exploration of quantum biology certainly has many
uses in various fields, and is definitely an area of research that will
expand.
?e future on these biological processes is an exciting one,
providing intellectually provocative, biologically centric models that
suggest new avenues for experimental and computational investigation
in a ‘quantum leap’ e??ort to discover if evolution, Darwin’s and
Wallace’s (and the scientific field of Biology) keystone theory, is
responsible for the incoherent mechanisms that drive biological
processes, and indeed, life itself. Even Schrodinger [3] himself implied
that the behaviour of living organisms approaches quantum
mechanical behaviours and that all biological systems involve the
movement of fundamental, quantum particles within their cells as
described by quantum mechanics.
