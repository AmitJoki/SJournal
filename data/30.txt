Abstract
Recording of hydrological parameters of a flood with conventional means often fails due to an extreme event
especially in developing countries like Bangladesh. Flood water causes a lot of property damage almost every year
and it demands to be controlled for economic growth by water management. The objective of the study is to analyze
the damages according to different land uses like urban area (Built-up) or agricultural lands, flood height and thus
the percentages of loss in different land use in various corresponding year. Naogaon District has been chosen as the
study area for this analysis. Remote Sensing data has been used in this context as remote sensing technology
along with Geographic Information System (GIS) has become a key tool for flood monitoring in recent years.
Satellite images which have been collected from Landsat 4-5 Thematic Mapper for the year 2004, 2007 and 2012
and Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) and Thermal Infrared Sensor (TIRS) images for the year 2017. In
each year images of different times (March and September) of Naogaon district have been analyzed with
Geographical Information System (GIS) and ERDAS Imagine software. The analysis demonstrate the variation of
land use changes in before and after flood occurrence month from 2004 to 2017 depends on this change. The
analysis also describe the relation of the flood in that four observation years as well as the percentages of loss
association with the flood spread, flood height, and land uses. The study helps to find out the losses and related
relations of flood and thus the importance of water management. The study demonstrates an encouragement to
further flood water management studies.

Introduction
Floods are one of the most common natural disasters leading to
economic losses and loss of human lives [1]. As monsoon rain kept on
pouring and overflowing the rivers in the country as well as the
upstream hilly regions of neighbouring countries, Bangladesh faces
flood D??ecting the northern, north-eastern and central part of the
country. Naogaon District is a mostly D??ected one in northern part [2].
Naogaon district has 10 rivers (Atrai River, Punarbhaba River, Little
Jamuna River, Gur River, Dhol River or Dhol Sea, Tulshiganga River,
Nagor River, Noor River, Fokinni River, Shiva River) [3]. ?ese rivers
overflow and causes flood and damage a huge property. Recently (in
2017) heavy floods have severely damaged properties valued around
Tk 300 crore in two upazilas of Naogoan district following the collapse
of a flood control embankment at Mirpur area under Atrai upazila in
the district. Floods have damaged about 23,000 houses, including 7,000
mud huts, worth around Tk 50 crore in Atrai and Raninagar upazilas
and 97 educational institutes have also been damaged in the two
upazilas. ?e recent floods have destroyed about 80 km of roads and
6.50 km of the flood control embankment causing a huge economic
loss [4]. Floods in 2017 damaged at least 50,000 acres of crops and
washed away fish in almost 1,000 ponds. Water in the Atrai River has
been 214 cm above the danger level, while the Chhoto Jamuna’s level
has been 70 cm above the danger line [5]. So, Naogaon District has bad
experiences of flood and that is why Naogaon District has been chosen
as the study area.
Land use and floods are closely related; therefore, any changes in the
land use, such as urbanization across the catchment’s area, may trigger
a sequence of flood occurrences and more economic loss [1].
Information on land use/land cover and its changes is very essential for
e??ective management of natural resources [6]. ?e impact of flood is
not only changes the land use, it also D??ects the community as it
destroy the community life [6]. ?e economic loss due to flood also
depends a lot on land uses; flood in urban area causes more loss than
the agricultural land. ?e land use in Naoagaon District has a change
with time. A chronological assessment can find out the relation
between land use and flood damage. In the study, the changes of the
study area has been analyzed from 2002 to 2017. ?e change detection
of land use/land cover is carried out using before and D?er flood
satellite images [7]. In the study, Landsat 4-5 TM, Landsat-8 OLI and
MODIS images are clDssified and analyzed with ERDAS imagine and
GIS. ?e aim of the study is to analyze the damages according to
di??erent land uses like Built-up area or agricultural lands and relation
between land use and flood helps to analyze the percentages of loss in
di??erent land use which will help the future flood management. ?is
study provides an easy, simple and short technique for producing flood
inundation maps from various satellite data by using Geographic
Information System (GIS) so?wDre tools.

88.75°E. ?e total study area was 3449.197 sq-km. It is bounded by the
West Bengal State of India on the north, Natore and Rajshahi district
on the south, Joypurhat, Bogra, and Natore districts on the east,
Nawabganj district on the west [8-10] (Figure 1).

Data used and its pre-processing
Landsat 4-5 TM, Landsat-8 OLI images (in the form of both surface
reflectDnce and NDVI at 30 m spatial resolution are freely available in
United States Geological Survey (USGS) websites [11,12]. For this
study, these images covering the study area and within the time frame
of 2004 to 2017 have been collected. ?e image collection considers
two di??erent times (i) in the flood happening month (July to
September) and (ii) when the flood is not occurring (December to
May). ?ese images were acquired with a combination of path-row
138-43 as this cover the study area. Upon acquiring all the required
datasets, we performed the following set of pre-processing steps to
both Landsat 4-5 TM and Landsat-8 OLI. ?ose included: (i) reprojecting
the images into Universal Traverse Mercator (UTM) Zone
46 N with World Geodetic System 1984 (WGS84) datum, (ii) clipping
the images to represent the study area (iii) Supervised clDssificDtion
before and D?er flood occurrence months and (iv) Watershed creation
during flood months.
Methodology
?e processing of data for evaluation has three major components:
(i) mapping of Naogaon area before and during the flood using
Landsat 4-5 TM and Landsat-8 OLI images (ii) determining the
percentage of land use damaged like (urban area or Agriculture land)
in the study area during the flood from 2004-2017 upon combining the
outcomes from the first two components through matrix union in
ERDAS imagine.
In order to map the pre and during flood period using Landsat 4-5
TM and Landsat-8 OLI a number of steps have been performed.
Firstly, a supervised clDssificDtion has been to classify the larger extent
of heterogeneous landscapes (includes various vegetation types).
Secondly, it has been intended to generate four major land cover
classes (i)Urban area, (ii)Agriculture land and Vegetation, (iii)Bare soil
and (iv)Water Body using 16-18 signatures for every image and recode
them into four classes using recode techniques in ERDAS imagine.
$?er getting two clDssified map from before and during the flood
occurring period finDll\ matrix union has been conducted between the
two maps to identify the damaged area using pixel value of two
di??erent maps.
Resulta and Discussion
Flood mapping assessment in Naogaon district
?e study area has experienced a huge amount of changes due to
flood during the year between 2004-2017. For the year of 2004, two
Landsat images are taken for analysis purpose. Figure 2 shows the land
use changes for two months in year 2004. In the figure the image of (a)
March 25, 2004 which is taken for showing the land use conditions
before occurring flood and the image of (b) October 19, 2004 is taken
for showing the lands use conditions of during flood
Figure 2: a) Land use map before occurring flood (March 25, 2004)
and b) Land use map during flood (October 19, 2004).
?e interpretation of Landsat image (a) represents that the study
area was 5.58% of the water body, 7.54% of the built-up area, 59.64% of
agricultural and vegetation land and 27.24% bare soil of 3449.197 sqkm
area. ?e data shows only 5.58% of water body existed before an
overflow of water. But D?er increasing the overflow of water in the
month of October 2004, the percentage of water body represents a
massive change. ?e Figure 2b shows the massive changes of water
body during the flood which D??ected all other land uses. ?e figure
represents that the percentage of water body converted from 5.58% to
25.68% which impacts on all other land uses. Due to an increase of
water body, the percentage of built-up area was also shi?ed from 7.54%
to 6.70%. Similarly, increasing of water body also e??ects on agricultural
and vegetation land and the percentage was shi?ed from 59.64% to
48.17% of 3449.197 sq-km lands. ?e percentage of bare soil also
decreased from 27.24% to 19.45%. ?e results indicate that, due to the
overflow of water most vegetation and agricultural land were flooded
which washed out most of the agricultural crops and causes negative
impacts on rural people as well as economy. In addition, 0.84% of the
built-up area was also flooded because of occurring flood and people
became homeless. ?e most underlying finding of the analysis of the
flood of 2004 is, the flood covers most of the land about 692.3052 sqkm
area of Naogoan District and washed out a huge amount of
agricultural crops and built-up areas.

Another analysis is taken place of the year of 2007 in Naogoan
District. Figure 3 represents the land use changes where the image of
(a) March 18, 2007 which is taken for showing the land use conditions
before occurring flood and the image of (b) August 7, 2007 is taken for
showing the lands use conditions of during flood ?e comparison of
the two images gives the information about the land use changes and
by why the changes occurred. If anyone concentrates the water body
changes of the year of di??erent months, then the percentage of flood
damage will be clDrified ?e Figure 3b shows the conditions during
the flood where the percentage of water body was 16.83% which was
converted from 5.78%. ?e amount of and flooded was 380.8071 sqkm
of 3449.197 sq-km. Due to an increase of water body, the
percentage of built-up area was also shi?ed from 10.2% to 8.69%.
Similarly, increasing of water body also e??ects on agricultural and
vegetation land and the percentage was shi?ed from 51.80% to 45.68%
of 3449.197 sq-km lands and bare soil land was shi?ed from 32% to
28.81% due to flood ?e result indicates that, due to the overflow of
water most vegetation and agricultural land were flooded which
washed out most of the agricultural crops and causes negative impacts
on rural people as well as economy. In addition, 1.33% of the built-up
area was also flooded because of occurring flood and people became
homeless.
Figure 3: a) Land use map before occurring flood (March 18, 2007)
and b) Land use map during flood (August 7, 2007).
Figure 4 shows the land use changes where the image of March 18,
2012 (a) which is taken for showing the land use conditions before
occurring flood and the image of June 30, 20012 (b) is taken for
showing the lands use conditions of during flood
?e interpretation of both images represents the geographic
descriptions of the flood In April there was only 9.60% of water body
but D?er occurring flood it raised to 33.02%. ?e percentage shows the
deadliest e??ects of the flood that not only D??ected by water body but
also D??ected all other land uses. ?e flood washed away 2.63% of the
built-up area which caused a huge amount of economic losses as well
as made the victims homeless. It also washed away the extensive
amount of agricultural and vegetation lands where percentage fall
down from 41.81% to 34.00%.
Figure 4: a) Land use map before occurring flood (March 18, 2012)
and b) Land use map during flood (June 30, 20012).
Recently the deadliest flood occurred recently all over Bangladesh
especially in the northern portion of the country. As Naogoan is
situated in the northern portion of Bangladesh, that’s why the district
was a direct victim of the action of the flood For analysis purpose two
Landsat images are taken which is shown in Figure 5. In the figure
represents the land use changes during the year of 2017. In the figure
the image of April 14, 2017 (a) which is taken for showing the land use
conditions before occurring flood and the image of August 5, 2017 (b)
is taken for showing the lands use conditions of during flood
Figure 5: a) Land use map before occurring flood (April, 2017) and
b) Land use map during flood (August, 2017).
?e result shows that, the percentage of water body increased
because of the overflow of water from 3.45% to 2.06% of 3449.197 sqkm.
It indicates that the increasing water D??ected all other land uses
mostly in agricultural and vegetation lands. ?e land uses such as
built-up area was shi?ed from 12.90% to 6.14%, agriculture and
vegetation lands were shi?ed from 37.76% to 24.79%.

Flood level change assessment
Figure 6 represents the flooded area with respect to their
corresponding year. In 2004 693.31 sq-km land was flooded and in
2007 the total under water land area was decreased to 38.81 sq.-km.
But in 2012, another flood acted in Naogoan District and the total
flooded area was increased to 807.89 sq.-km and recently in 2007 the
total flooded area was 676.34 sq-km.
Figure 6: Area (sq.km) under Water during Flood.
Figure 7 shows the percentages of the water body at flood occurring
moths. ?e line shows that, in 2004 the percentage of water body
increased to 25.68% due to flood Similarly, due to flood the
percentage of water body increased in 2007, 2012 and 2017 to 16.83%,
33.02% and 23.06%. ?e key finding of the analysis is, the percentage
of a water body can be increased more than 30% and if it will, then the
extensive area of valuable land would go under water and would create
a physical and economic loss of Naogoan District.
Figure 7: Percentage of Water Body at Flood Occurring Months.
Damage assessment of agricultural land and buildup area
during ?RRG
Figures 8 and 9 shows the total percentage of loss during flood with
their corresponding year. ?e figure represents that percentage of
damage to built-up area was increasing year D?er year, that means due
to increasing of urbanization, built-up area damages was increasing
from 0.84% to 6.76%. In the year 2017, people of Naogoan District
su??ered most because of losing their household due to food.
In addition, the figure also represents the total percentage of
agricultural and vegetable damaged land with its corresponding year.
?e percentage fluctuDted in a di??erent year. In 2004, the percentage
was 11.47% but in 2007 the percentage decreased to 6.12%. $?er 2007,
the damage of agricultural and vegetation land was increased and
turned to 16.47% in 2017. ?e most underlying key point is that, dayby-day
due to flood property as well as agricultural and vegetation
lands are destroyed most and therefore the economic loss is increasing
constantly which adversely D??ect the country’s economic condition.

Conclusion
?e research presented in this article formulates an e?cient
methodology to accurately delineate the flooded areas with the help of
remote sensing data and GIS tools in Naogoan District, Bangladesh.
Flash flood is a natural hazard that poses a risk to both populations,
structures and agriculture land within the D??ected areas. ?ere are
several factors that D??ect the amount of runo?? which help determine
the intensity of flooding ?erefore physical characteristics such as
impervious surfaces, the hydraulic rating of soil, and flow
accumulation of water were combined with demographic
characteristics to create a composite flood hazard index. In this paper

some applications of ArcMap are used to calculate the flooded area
using LANDSAT Images. It is estimated that the LANDSAT data could
help to map the flooded area with an accuracy of 73–81% depending
on various indices used. From the analysis of flood damaged area from
2004 to 2017 most damages happen in the agricultural and vegetation
lands and in every five years interval its keep raising from 3.95.62
sq.km (11.47%) to 16.47% area. ?e maps can help the decision makers
to identify the flood risk zones. It also helps the decision makers for
planning residential, urban and land use system of a catchment area. It
also provides the useful information to the town planners to use
relocation, mitigation, modernization, flood protection and flood
management system to reduce the properties and live losses. ?e study
also suggests the further use of the remote sensing data and GIS tools
for flood risk zones mapping. ?e study shows that Naogoan District
area comes under high risk due to low gradient and slope watershed
and surrounded by numerous small and large rivers and here needs
proper flood management by accurate flood mapping.
