Abstract
This research was done because of the continuous alert of coastal erosion due to sea level rise and also due to
the fact that habitats and living beings will be affected. All these will be affected because of a submerged breakwater
structure constructed near the shoreline to reduce the effect of strong waves without disturbing the ocean view.
Further on to this, the study will see whether there are other disadvantages of constructing the submerged
breakwater or not. A 2D experimental was done consisting of 60 simulations with four different types of submerged
breakwater models heights, and one simulation is using no structure. The results were then recorded to get the
piling-up of the runnings for the different structures.
What was found out was that the piling-up is influenced by certain parameters. Those parameters are (1) pilingup
is influenced by structure parameter in terms of structure depth, Rc and (2) piling-up also influenced by wave
parameters in terms of Period, T. From the study, it is concluded that the influenced of piling-up to wave parameters,
Rc is directly proportional and with respect to Period, T the piling-up is inversely proportional.

Introduction
Background
As one of the biggest archipelagic country in the world, Indonesia
possesses a coastal line length of about 54,716 km and the country also
having the second longest coastal line in the world a?er Canada.
Which means having long coastal lines, indicates that more people
lives in the coastal line area. With Indonesia the fourth most populated
country in the world, a lot of people can be found settling in the areas
close to the beach. Recently the beaches and coastline have faced and
experienced many problems with regards to erosion and abrasion.
Because of this, a suggested and preferred solution is the application
of beach nourishment. Beach Nourishment according to Robert Dean
[1].
“Comprises the placement of sediment in the nearshore to advance
the shoreline seaward and is usually placed in response to beach
erosion which may be naturally or anthropogenically induced.
Nourishment with compatible sediment has the advantage of
maintaining the beach system in a near natural condition and can
provide benefits to biota and upland property, the latter by bu??ering
storm erosion and damage”.
In this case it is a process in which sand that has been eroded is
being replaced by filling back the sand like in (Figure 1a). However, by
doing this, it needs large and enormous amount of sand volume.
?erefore in order to reduce the amount of sand volume used, the use
of submerged structure using Geotube material is applied in (Figure
1b) In this case the sand is only filled from the structure up to the
coastline. Based on (Figure 1) below, it shows the amount of sand
volume without the present of structure and with the present of
structure. ?e problem of reducing sand nourishment may be
achieved, but another possible problem may arise. Having the presence
of submerged structure may as well increase the Mean Sea Level
(MSL). Increasing this, could influence and cause the shoreline to
retreat [2].
Figure 1: Sand nourishment.
Research problem
As mentioned earlier, the problem is the increased MSL. When MSL
increased therefore shoreline retreats as a result cause problems for
those living very close to the shoreline. An illustration in Figure 2
shows a possibility of increased MSL and shoreline retreat.

Objectives and aims
?e main aims of this research are to investigate the e??ect of:
• wave parameters influencing to the piling-up, and
• Structure parameters influencing to the piling-up.
Focus
?is research will focus mainly in:
• Regular waves
• Structure located before breaking of the waves
• One type of sand (Krakal of size 0.433 mm)
• Structure material used is Geotube.

?ere are many benefits of this research however, one benefit is to
be able to determine and know the preferable design for the submerged
structure without causing much piling up (increasing of MSL).
Literature Review
Piling-up
?e pilling-up a phenomenon as described by Diskin is:
“An expression of the quasi-equilibrium reached between the mean
rate or water flowing into the protected zone by waves breaking over
the low or submerged breakwater, and that of water flowing out of the
protected zone as a result of the di??erence in mean water levels inside
and outside. ?e two flows are unsteady and periodic, having a period,
T, equal to that of the wave train” [3].
Previous research by Ruol P, Faedo A and Paris A (2003)
Aim of the investigation was to evaluate the behavior of this kind of
structure in terms of reflection and transmission of incident waves, as
well as the study of the wave overtopping phenomenon and the
associated increase in the water levels behind the breakwater (water
piling-up). ?e wave-structure interaction was examined by
reproducing about 70 irregular wave attacks. In the first part of the
study a rubble mound permeable breakwater was analyzed, while in
the second part of the research an impermeable plate was placed on the
landward slope of the structure, in order to study in more details the
complex phenomena of the wave overtopping over the structure and of
the seepage through it, also related to the piling-up level at the back of
the structure [4].
Previous research by Diskin HM, Vajda M and Amir I (1970)
In his paper, he mentioned that altogether some 190 tests were
carried out on the two trapezoidal breakwaters. Plotting the values of
the height of piling-up, Pu, against the waveheight, Ho, led to a family
of curves for various values of the submergence, S. Again there was
considerable scatter about the mean curves. Following a dimensional
analysis of the variables involved in the piling-up phenomenon, it was
decided to use the wave height, Ho, as a basis for non-dimensional
quantities and to plot the relative piling-up (Pu/Ho) against the relative
submergence (S/Ho).

Wave theory
Ocean waves are mostly caused by the action of wind on water. ?e
waves are formed primarily by a complex process of resonance and
shearing action, in which waves of di??ering wave height, length and
period are produced and travel in numerous directions. Once formed,
ocean waves can travel vast distances, spreading in area and reducing
in height, but maintaining wavelength and period.
Airy wave equations derivation: ?e Airy wave was derived using
the concepts of two-dimensional ideal fluid flow ?is is a reasonable
starting point for ocean waves, which are not greatly influenced by
viscosity, surface tension or turbulence. Figure 3 shows a sinusoidal
wave of wavelength L, height H and period T. ?e variation of surface
elevation with time, from the still-water level, is denoted by (referred
to as excursion) [5] and given by, ?=

Radiation stress (momentum flux theory: ?is theory is used to
explain the phenomenon of wave set-up and longshore current
generation. Radiation stress is defined as the excess flow of momentum
due to the presence of waves (with units of force/unit length). It arises
from the orbital motion of individual water particles in the waves.
?ese particle motions produce a net force in the direction of
propagation (SXX) and a net force at right angles to the direction of
propagation (SYY). ?e original theory was developed by LonguetHiggins
and Stewart [6]. Its application to longshore currents was
subsequently developed by Longuet-Higgins [7]. ?e interested reader
is strongly recommended to refer to these papers that are both
scientifically elegant and presented in a readable style. Further details
may also be found in Horikawa and Komar [8,9].
Shoaling: Consider first a wave front travelling parallel to the seabed
contours (i.e. no refraction is taking place). Making the assumption
that wave energy is transmitted shoreward without loss due to bed
friction or turbulence,

Surf zone processes, wave breaking: ?ere are two criteria which
determine when a wave will break. First is a limit to wave steepness
and second is a limit on the wave height to water depth ratio.
?eoretical limits have been derived from solitary wave theory, which
is a single wave with a crest and no trough. Such a wave was first
observed by Russell in 1840, being produced by a barge on the Forth
and Clyde canal. ?e two criteria are given by:
Steepness H/L<1/7. ?is normally limits the height of deep-water
waves.

In practice ? can vary from about 0.4 to 1.2 depending on beach
slope and breaker type in Figure 5.

Non-dimensional analysis
As Yuwono states, to write down the dimensions of the variables
defined in the field of hydraulic engineering systems usually used. ?at
is MLT writing dimensions, by using 3-dimensional principal
elements: Mass (M), Length (L) and Time (T). ?e scale of the various
variables or parameters described in dimensionless numbers, such as
Reynolds number, Froude number and so on. Dimensionless numbers
in addition to determining the relationship between the scales is also
used to describe the results of the study [10]. Dimensional analysis is
used to determine the dimensionless numbers and it is shown or done
as follows:-
(1) Basic echelon matrix, (2) Buckingham, (3) Rayleigh, (4)
Stepwise, and (5) Langhaar; in this study the analysis of the NDP (nondimensional
parameter) used stepwise method dimensional Matrix
where the dimensions of the variables used in this study as follows:
Pu = L RC = L H = L

Test Results
Wave height (Hi), wave period (T) and breakwater depth (Rc)
?e wave height data was obtained from a wave recorder using a
probe to measure and record directly into the wave so?ware installed
on a computer machine. From the so?ware all the data are saved in a
format of an excel document in which the minimum and maximum
heights were recorded. For each submerged breakwater, a record was
done for two occasions. ?e first is when the water is still, then the
wave heights were recorded and saved into excel document. Secondly
is at the time when the wave is formed, wave height is also recorded.

Table 2 is the result from the recorded excel. ?is table includes the
result for one of the structure (RC=-1.0 cm), all the Periods, T,
involved in the experiment and all the Stroke, S. From this table, the
result of the piling up can be obtained and then wave height (Hi) was
calculated.
Analysis
,nfluHnFH of wave steepness
?e illustration in Figure 7 below shows that the Piling up (Pu/Ho)
parameters have being influenced with the decrease of wave steepness.
Rc/ hs=-0.04 is the least steepness however the graph shows the highest
piling up impact and the highest steepness of Rc/hs=0.28 have
approximately 30% of the least steepness of the wave. ?is shows that
having a submerge breakwater with less wave steepness will have more
impact towards piling up. ?erefore the results contribute to the
understanding that the number of occurrences for lower wave
steepness has more influence towards piling up.
Figure 7: ?e influence of Ho/gT2 to Pu/Ho for Rc/hs=-0.04,
+-0.10,+0.14, and +0.28.
Figure 7 shows that Structure Rc=-1.0 cm is represented by a nondimensional
analysis of RC/hs=-0.04. Similarly for Structure RC=2.5
cm, RC=3.5 cm and RC=7.0 cm are all represented by nondimensional
analysis of RC/hs=0.10, RC/hs=0.14, and RC/hs=0.28.
,nfluHnFH of structure parameters
From the Figure 8, the graph clearly illustrates a trend that as Rc/hs
decreases then the Pu/H decreases also. Moreover, when Period T=1.0

s, 1.2 s, 1.4 s, 1.6 s, and 1.8 s, the Pu/H increases also as shown in
Figure 8. Further to that, when looking at the Structure Parameter (Rc/
hs), when it increases the depth from 0.025 m – 0.07 m depth, there is
a reduction of piling up (Pu/Ho).
Figure 8: ?e influence of rc/hs to pu/ho for periods (t)=1.0 s, 1.2 s,
1.4 s, 1.6 s.
When having all Rc/hs=-0.04, 0.10, 0.14 and 0.28, the result is
similar to Figure 8 which shows that as the parameter H/gT2 increase,
the Pu/H decreases. When referring to Rc/hs from 0.04 to -0.28, Pu/H
decreases also. In this case, the greater the Rc/hs is, the greater the
Pu/H and the greater the H/gT2, the less the Pu/H.
,nfluHnFH of Rc/H compared to Diskin’s s/h
Figure 9: ?e influence of Rc/ho to pu/h for Rc/hs=0.04, -0.10,
-0.14, and -0.28.
Figure 9 illustrates the graphical outcome of the experiment that
was done. Represented from the right to the le? is the use of structures
of Rc=-1.0 m to Rc=7.0 cm. It is clearly noticed that the trend is
ascending up towards the le? however a maximum cannot be possibly
determined because there is no indication of going down towards the
le?
Figure 10: Trapezoidal submerged breakwater experimental results,
(Diskin, 1970).
Figure 9 and Figure 10 are of di??erent materials of submerged
breakwater. ?is experimental is using Geotube as the material and
Diskin’s experiment is using rubble mound trapezoidal submerged
breakwater. However, the main concept is to find or investigate the
e??ect of Piling up Pu/H. Diskin’s notation for Rc=S which means Rc/H
for this experiment refers to S/H for Diskin’s experiment. In Figure 10
it can be seen that the trends keeps on increasing towards the le? and
reaches it maximum then decrease again still toward the le? However,
as mentioned earlier in Figure 9, the increasing towards the le? cannot
really indicate when it will decrease towards the le? But the important
thing is that it can be found out that by combining both Figure 9 and
Figure 10, a resultant of Figure 11 can be seen. ?e result shows that
this experiment is within Diskin’s Experiment and therefore having a
geotube material makes less di??erence than the rubble mound
trapezoidal submerged breakwater. As long as there is a submerged
structure of any material, a resultant would be Piling Up.
Figure 11: Experimental results for geo tube submerged breakwater
comparation with Diskin’s results.
From Figure 11, the current experiment data can be found to be
located within the range of Diskin’s Data and in the Figure, it is
between the range of S/Ho=-0.25 to S/Ho=0.75.Note that the
interpretation that Diskin (1970) use states that as Rc is above the
Mean Water Level (MWL), the value becomes negative (-ve) that is
Rc=-1.0 cm. ?erefore when Rc is below the MWL, the value becomes
positive (+ve) for Rc=2.5 cm, Rc=3.5 cm and Rc=7.0 cm.

Figure 12: ?e influence of Ho/gT2 to Pu/Ho.
Source: Analysis Result Data, 2011.
Based on Figure 12 above, in the case of design, for example a given
wave period for a particular beach in Indonesia T=12.0 s. ?en the
wave steepness could be found with g=9.81 ms-2 and assuming
Ho=0.081 m. ?erefore the wave steepness is calculated as Ho/gT2 ˜
0.0057. With the use of Figure 12 a structure of RC could be selected,
Depending whether the piling-up is acceptable or not [11,12]. An
illustration as shown below in Figure 13.
Figure 13: Determining the piling-up.
Given:
Ho/gT2=(0.081 m)/ ((9.81 ms-2) * (12 s) 2) ˜ 0.0057
Submerged Structure: RC=+1.5 m
Piling-up: Pu/Ho=0.26 about 26% (Figure 13)
If somehow other submerged structure were used for the design,
then the result could probably be as follows:-
• Submerged Structure: RC=-1.0 m=Piling-up: about 38% (Figure
13)
• Submerged Structure: RC=+2.5 m=Piling-up: about 22% (Figure
13)
• Submerged Structure: RC=+5.0 m=Piling-up: about 9% (Figure
13).
Conclusion
With the limitation that this research will focus mainly in regular
waves, structure located before breaking of the waves, one type of sand
(Krakal of size 0.433 mm), and structure material used is Geotube,
there are some conclusions that can be obtained as follows:-
• It is determined that for the increasing wave parameters (Ho/gT2),
the piling up (Pu) decreases.
• For the structure parameters (RC/hs), when it decrease from RC/
hs=0.28 to RC/hs=-0.04, the piling up (Pu) decrease (Figure 7).
?erefore a final conclusion based on Figure 13, the higher the
wave period, T is then Ho/gT2 will tend to go towards to le? In this
case, based again on the Figure 13 the piling up will increase. So with
the graphically illustration it can be easier to select which type of
submerged breakwater to choose to avoid greater piling up.
In addition, this results should be considered for the impact that a
submerged breakwater would have towards the coastline.
Suggestions
• According to the research, there are some suggestions for further
studies:
• It seems that from the result and analysis there is need to add more
structures in the case of finding the maximum Piling-up, Pu in
order to compare properly with Diskin’s finding
• Also it is recommended that more research on Piling-up should be
carried out in order to know and discover the significant that
piling up can cause to the coastal shoreline.
• Lastly but not the least, if the research have a good foundation of
results and analysis, this could be used for future design of
submerged breakwater.
