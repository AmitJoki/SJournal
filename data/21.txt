Abstract
Fingerprints begin forming at about the 6th to the 13th week of gestation. A number of factors determine the print
pattern in the womb, including the density of the amniotic fluid surrounding the foetus, the size of the foetus, the
friction in the womb, the location in the womb amongst others. Once developed the pattern remains constant
throughout life. Basically there are three main patterns; The Loop, which rise up and loop back around, continuing
on the same direction it started from and it accounts for about 70% of all fingerprints, Arches look like waves that
rise and fall on the same fingerprint pattern, accounting for 5% whiles the Whorls appear as circular patterns
accounting for 25%. The loop has only one delta, the Arch no delta with the Whorl pattern having two deltas. In the
case presented here, a young man of 30 years, who is physically fit and normal without any significant clinical
condition apart from a developmental defect of the right thumb which makes it different from the left thumb. From the
ten fingerprint patterns taken with the aid of a scanner from the subject, only the abnormal right thumb of the subject
with a whorl fingerprint pattern has three deltas which are extremely uncommon and quite different to the traditional,
widely known two deltas seen in all whorl patterns in fingerprints. Fingerprint deltas are only present in loops and
whorls. There are basically four types of fingerprint whorls. The plain with two deltas, central pocket with two deltas,
the double loop whorls with two deltas and accidental whorls which have two or more deltas. Theoretically, less than
1 in 1000 people has these extremely rare fingerprints. The three deltas in a fingerprint whorl pattern may exist in
accidental whorls, but no mention is made of it in plain whorls which make this case perhaps the first ever of a
known plain whorl with three deltas. This feature is very uncommon in normal patterns. In this case the thumb of this
young man has developed abnormally in the womb and has a whorl pattern with three deltas. It is imperative this
pattern is taken into consideration when evaluating or interpreting fingerprints. Though the number may be
statistically small, it is still essential this is taken into account in manual and especially when using automatic
fingerprint identification software to evaluate known and unknown fingerprints.

Introduction
2?en an investigating officer discovers the single, partial, or only
details of a fingerprint at a crime scene, which may be the only forensic
evidence found at the scene. ?is single detail of a fingerprint helps the
crime scene examiners in establishing the identity of an individual as
the fingerprints of every individual are completely unique to that
individual and no other living person. A fingerprint is the most reliable
criteria for identificDtion as they remain same for the entire duration of
life. Fingerprinting is one of the oldest forensic evidence techniques
which are used for the recognition and unique identificDtion of an
individual for law enforcement purposes [1]. An earthenware vessel
estimated to be 6000 years old was discovered in northwest China and
found to bear a clearly visible friction ridge impression and is
considered to be the oldest friction ridge skin impression of a
fingerprint found to date. It is still debateable whether they were placed
by accident or specificDll\ to make a decorative pattern on the pot [2].
In earlier times there was no opportunity for additional means of
identificDtion. Such evidence as signatures photographs and to
personal e??ects could be used but in several cases of accident, murder,
or suicide where the bodies of unknown were uncovered identificDtion
was quite problematic without fingerprints [3]. Fingerprint friction
ridge skin has unique features that persist from birth until
decomposition D?er death.
?e unique fingerprint pattern begins with the formation by the
sixth month of gestation. ?e uniqueness of friction ridge skin falls
under the larger umbrella of biological uniqueness and no two points
of reference of any living organism are exactly alike [4]. Around the 6th
and 7th weeks of gestation, the paddle like hand of the foetus begins to
develop fingers [5]. Volar pads starts appear on the palm (inter-digital
pads first followed by thenar and hypothenar pads) around 7th to 8th
weeks of gestation and the major development of friction ridge skin
occurs around 11th and 20th weeks of gestation [6]. ?e morphology of
volar pads results into fingerprint patterns which are unique in terms
of types and location of microscopic details [5]. According to Galton,
fingerprints are clDssified into three features which are arches, loops
and whorls. It is found that about 60-65% of population have loops,
30-35% of the population have whorls and 5-10% of population have
arches [7]. Generally, Arches are formed when the ridges run from one
side of the bulb to the other side of the bulb without forming any
background turn or twist. Loops are formed when there is a single
backward turn without any twist. Whorls are formed when there is at
least one complete circle, they are also considered to include all duplex
spirals [3]. Fingerprint deltas are only present in loops and whorls.
?ere are basically four types of fingerprint whorls. ?e plain with two
deltas, the central pocket with two deltas, the double loop whorls with
two deltas and accidental whorls which have two or more deltas. ?e

whorl mainly comprises at least two deltas with a re-curve in front of
each but there are a few accidental whorls which have three or more
deltas characteristic of two or more di??erent pattern types [8]. In the
present study, a young man of 30 years, who is physically fit had a
developmental defect of the right thumb which makes it di??erent from
the le? thumb. ?e right thumb which has developed abnormally in
the womb has a whorl pattern with three deltas. ?erefore this unique
pattern has been taken into consideration for the study and analysis of
fingerprints.
Materials and Methods
In the present study, a unique fingerprint whorl pattern was
discovered which shows the abnormal development of the subjects
thumb during the fetal development of the person. ?is study should
be taken into consideration for the improvement of the efficienc\ of
biometric systems which have been in use for several years. Listed
below are the materials used during this examination: Fingerprint
Sample, Hand Lens, Scale, Scanner (cogent system) and Camera.
Methodology
To collect the fingerprint sample from the subject (age 30)who is
identified as having this unique fingerprint pattern the subject was
asked to clean his hands thoroughly with soap and water and dry them
using towel to enhance getting both clear photographs and print of the
fingerprint. Firstly photographs of the full hand were taken followed by
a close up view photographs that focus on the thumbs so that the
unique fingerprint pattern can be clearly visualized (Figure 1).
Figure 1: Front, back of hand and close up view of thumb.
For recording offline and online methods were used. In the offline
method, the subject was asked to press his fingertip was pressed against
an ink slab and then on the paper for getting the impression on the
fingerprint card which was later on scanned for storing electronically.
Care must be taken while recording the offline fingerprint it is
important to prevent smudging of the print.
In the online method or live scan, the subject was asked to directly
place the fingerprint over the scanner and record the fingerprint
digitally. $?er acquiring fingerprints details such as name, sex, and
age, blood group were noted. $?er storing the fingerprint image
electronically we proceeded to two levels of examination i.e. level 1 and
level 2. ?e fingerprint pattern was studied with the help of magnifying
glass for identifying the pattern and microscopic details in level 1 and
level 2 respectively.
Results
?e collected fingerprint patterns were examined for the two
identifying patterns and microscopic features in level 1 and level 2
respectively. Level 1 mainly refers to the overall pattern formed by the
flow papillary ridges on the papillary surface. ?ese patterns are
clDssified into generic classes by Galton et al [3,9] into arches, loops,
and whorls [6].
Whorls are further clDssified into four distinct group such as plain,
central pocket loop, double loop, and accidental. Any whorl clDssified
under accidental whorl clDssificDtion will either contain two or more
patterns [7]. ?e accidental whorl pattern may have three or more
deltas with all the characteristics of two or more patterns types [8]. As
per the theory concerning the whorl pattern, a whorl pattern with
three deltas was recognized for the first time in the example shown in
Figure 2 which was due to abnormal fetal development of the thumb.
Figure 2: Whorl pattern showing three deltas.
$?er recognizing the pattern of the fingerprint we proceeded for
the level 2 examination. In level 2 mainly major ridge path deviations
or micro features or Galton characteristics are observed and
recognized.
?e micro features observed in level two are individual to every
person and even micro features are considered as individual
characteristics also. ?e subjects fingerprints were taken for level 2
examination in which following micro features like core, delta,
bifurcation, lake, hook/spur, bridge, enclosure, island, ridge ending and
double bifurcation were observed shown in (Figure 3).

for study.

Figure 4: Showing the ridge characteristics observed in the
fingerprint.
• Core: Center of the fingerprint pattern
• Delta: Point on a ridge at or in front of and nearest the center of the
divergence of the type lines
• Bifurcation: Point where one friction ridge divides into two friction
ridges.
• Lake: Large size enclosures are called in which single friction ridge
first bifurcates and then converge and continues as a single friction
ridge.
• Hook/Spur: Point where a ridge bifurcates with one short ridge
branching from a long ridge.
• Bridge: Connecting friction ridge between the two parallel ridges
which meets the ridge at an acute angle.
• Enclosure: Single friction ridge in the shape of ellipse that
bifurcates to fuse and re-joins or converges and continues as a
single friction ridge.
• Island: Ridges slightly longer than dots, occupying space between
two temporarily divergent ridges
• Ridge Ending: Single friction ridge that terminates and come to an
abrupt end within the friction ridge structure.
• Double Bifurcation: Point where ridge bifurcates again from a
bifurcated ridge [5,10-15].
Discussion
Fingerprints are most commonly encountered as latent prints at the
various crime scenes. In the present study, a unique fingerprint was
observed for identifying the pattern and minutiae’s or ridge
characteristics. Galton [3], had already clDssified the fingerprint into
three arches, loops and whorls on the basis of the degree of curvature
of the ridges and even said that, “?ere are few ambiguous patterns,
and others which are non-descript, but the former are uncommon and
latter rare; As these exceptions give little real inconvenience in
recognition”.
Henry [9], clDssified the fingerprint pattern in four main types such
as Arches, Loops, Whorls and Composite which are further clDssified
into simple and tented arch, ulnar and radial loop, single and double
whorls and central pockets loop, lateral pockets loop, twinned loop
and accidental loops (irregular in outline to be grouped under any of
the mentioned pattern). Later on (mentioned in his book “Friction
ridge skin: Comparison and identificDtion of fingerprints” that the
accidental whorl patterns have three or more deltas, and have all the
characteristics of two or more di??erent pattern types. As per the
present theory about the accidental whorl pattern with three or more
delta, in this paper a similar type of fingerprint pattern is discussed for
the first time. In this study, a young man fingerprint pattern is
discussed who has a developmental defect in the right thumb.
Conclusion
In the present study, a young man of 30 years who has a
developmental defect in the right thumb in comparison to his le?
thumb was observed. In this it was noted that the subject has an
accidental whorl fingerprint pattern with three deltas which was
identified as an unusual pattern in comparison to the broadly known
whorl fingerprint pattern with similar type of minutiae’s or ridge
characteristics.
