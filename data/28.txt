Introduction
Hyderabad is the sixth largest city in India and has the population of
67,31,790 [1] that demands huge quantity of water to fulfill the various
activities. It is a well-known fact that ground water recharge has always
been linked with surface water. The city has two major water bodies,
such as Hussain Sagar lake and Mir Alam Tank that are situated within
the corporation limits. Also, there are some smaller lakes located at
Nallakunta, Jubilee Hills, Ramanthapur and other places. In addition,
Musi river is the other source of water flows through an area subjected
to occasional torrential rains. There are two dams built on the Musi
river that are Osman Sagar and Himayat Sagar. Both of the reservoirs
constitute the major drinking water sources for Hyderabad. The major
sources of surface water to Hyderabad are given in detail in Table 1
with capacity of water drawl and type of treatment [2] (Figure 1).
Methodology
Description of study area
Hyderabad has a tropical wet and dry climate bordering on a hot
semi-arid climate. The annual mean temperature is 26.6°C (79.9°F);
monthly mean temperatures is 21–33°C (70–91°F). The ground water
level of the city shows considerable variations during the year with
a depth of around 10 to 15m in the summer months and depth of
around 2 m to 8 m during the monsoon months. Among 37 mandals of
Rangareddy district in Hyderabad, saroor nagar mandal serves as the
second largest one that consists of many towns and villages [3]. Hence
saroor nagar has been chosen as the study area. Six sampling locations
in this mandal were selected based upon the population and the nature
of living, which are given in Tables 2 and 3. The present scenario of
ground water levels in the study area is shown in the following Figure 2.
Lal Bahadur Nagar is called as L. B. Nagar, it is a commercial and
residential hub in Hyderabad, Telangana, India. This is located at
main entrance for Hyderabad when approaching the city from eastern
direction through Vijayawada highway NH 65. Bhupesh Guptha Nagar
is located in Jillelaguda of Hyderabad City. TKR College is located
in medbowli area of Meerpet municipality, Hyderabad. The college
campus is spread over an area of 15 acres of land and having a strength
of more than 9000 students and faculties. The other area, Nandhi hills is
located at a distance of 2 km from TKR College and spread over an area
of 15 sq.km within the Meerpet municipality, Hyderabad. Badangpet
is a Nagar Panchayath located in Saroornagar mandal of Rangareddy
district of Telangana. India. Last location, Balapur is a suburb in Ranga
Reddy district of the Indian state of Telangana, which is located in
Balapur mandal of Kandukur revenue division. Also, Table 2 explains
in detail about towns and villages of Saroornagar Mandal [4-7].
Location of sampling stations
Ground water samples were directly collected from hand pump -
bore well having a depth of 150 -250ft. Totally, 12 water samples were
collected during both monsoon (6 samples in pre-monsoon and 6
samples in post monsoon). The grab sampling techniques was used to
collect samples, preservations and analysis were carried out as per the
standard methods [8-10].
Polyethylene bottle where used to collect samples, after the sample
collection, it was transported to Teegala Krishna Reddy College of
Engineering and Technology for preservation and analysis. Nine
Physico-chemical parameters were analysed to check the quality
of ground water such as Temperature, pH, EC, Total dissolved
solids, Total hardness, Calcium hardness, Turbidity, Chlorides and
Bicarbonate (Table 3).
Results and Discussion
Drinking water quality standard- BIS 10500 (1991) is given in Table
4. The water quality data of 12 samples at six locations is presented
in Tables 5 and 6. Ground water quality analysis report mentioned in
Tables 4 and 5 reveals that pH value of ground water were occurring in

Abstract
Indian subcontinent has blessed with abundant water resources in the form perennial rivers and subsurface water.
Every citizen of this country has the responsibility and duty towards protecting these most precious resources. Yet
there is a scenario in India that thousands of people from different region are deprived of this due to over exploitation,
poor management system. In this line, we have selected Saroor Nagar Mandal in Hyderabad City of Telangana state
for conducting a model study on assessing groundwater quality. The study has been carried out in 6 locations of
Saroornagar Mandal during pre-monsoon and post monsoon seasons by collecting 12 nos of bore water samples.
Nine parameters were chosen for the analysis such as Temperature, pH, EC, Total dissolved solids, Total hardness,
Calcium hardness, Turbidity, Chlorides and Bicarbonates. Finally, results of the analysis were compared with water
quality standards such as BIS 10500 (1991) and CPHEEO manual of water sample and treatment. From this study, it
was observed that calcium content was higher in few locations while other parameters were within the permissible limits.

the ranges of 6.2 to 6.9 for all samples, which are within the permissible
range as per water quality Standards. The Electrical Conductivity
(EC) Values of ground water were in the ranges of 479-2255 µS/cm.
The highest value of 2255 EC was recorded in sampling location at
Bhupeshpur during post monsoon. The other 11 samples showed lower
EC values within the permissible limits. Total Hardness is reported in
terms of calcium carbonate, it ranges from 300 to 390 mg/L for all 12
samples and are within the permissible limit. Total dissolved solids are
in the ranges of 214 to 308 mg/L for all samples and are within the
permissible limit. The minimum and maximum values of Calcium in
the six locations are 75 and 271 mg/L, respectively. Out of which, 4

samples are recorded higher values of calcium that is more than 200
mg/L and higher than the permissible limits of BIS standard. The values
of Chloride for all the samples were in the range of 173 to 239 mg/L,
which are within the permissible limit. Bicarbonates are the primary
source of Carbonate and the dissolved form of carbon dioxide (CO2
) in
rain. The values of bicarbonates in all the samples were in the ranges of
170 to 280 mg/L, which are within the desirable limit [11-14].
Effects of Calcium
Calcium and magnesium the two most common minerals that
dissolve in water and make water as "Hard." The degree of hardness
becomes greater as the calcium and magnesium content increases
and is related to the concentration of multivalent cations dissolved
in the water. Hard water interferes with almost every cleaning task
from laundering and dishwashing to bathing and personal grooming.
Clothes laundered in hard water may look dingy and feel harsh and
scratchy. Dishes and glasses may be spotted when dry. Hard water
may cause a film on glass shower doors, shower walls, bathtubs, sinks,
faucets, etc. Hair washed in hard water may feel sticky and look dull.
Water flow may be reduced by deposits in pipes. Water hardness causes
cardiovascular disease in human beings [15] (Figure 3).
Conclusion
The extent of study area of Saroornagar sub-basin is 40.5 sq.km,
out of which an area of 4.06 sq.km has covered in this study and
distributed into 6 different locations. It was found that the ground
water quality at badangpet (L5) and Balapur (L6) loacations have been
deteriorated by higher concentration of calcium. In other four study
areas L1 to L4, the groundwater quality is well within standard limit.
Similarly, Ground water quality at Bhubesh nagar (L2) location has
been deteriorated with higher solid content, which was reflected in EC
values. The Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC) must
take appropriate measure to treat the groundwater before its supply to
public by reducing calcium level.
