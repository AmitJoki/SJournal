Introduction
Background and Justification
Rising fossil fuel burning and land use changes have emitted,
and are continuing to emit, increasing quantities of greenhouse
gases into the Earth’s atmosphere. This increase in heat has led to
the greenhouse effect, resulting in climate change and variability.
The main characteristics of climate change are increases in average
global temperature (global warming); changes in cloud cover and
precipitation particularly over land; melting of ice caps and glaciers and
reduced snow cover; and increases in ocean temperatures and ocean
acidity due to seawater absorbing heat and carbon dioxide from the
atmosphere. Evidence increasingly suggests that high climate variability
has significant impacts on rural households particularly in sub-Saharan
Africa. The impacts of climate change phenomena are progressively
emerging as an unprecedented global challenge to development in
general and poverty reduction in particular especially among millions
of rural people living in marginal regions with minimal livelihood
options. Numerous studies have shown that as variability in climatic
elements increases, the vulnerability of rural livelihoods and the ability
of smallholder households to deal with its shocks and stresses increases.
This is particularly so among rural households who often suffer immense
social and economic effects due to effects of climatic condition. Indeed,
in the past two decades, the effects of climate variability on crops and
livestock are increasingly blamed for deteriorating livelihoods among
most rural areas [1].
The impacts of climate variability on agricultural sector negatively
affect both crops and livestock production systems. Given the overdependence
on rain-fed agriculture by the majority of people living in
rural areas, climate change and variability has been limiting agriculture
production and thus resulting in food insecurity and low-income
generation [2,3] underlines that increased temperature and more critical
drought conditions would likely erode the natural capital (resource)
base of sustainable pastoralism which will be manifested though
scarcity of pasture and water resources. This resource scarcity, it is
argued, in addition to massive pastoral poverty, is considered to trigger
severe resource competition and violent conflicts among pastoralist
communities. According to Birch [4] and Wassie [5], traditional
pastoralism typically represents a resilient and unique system of
adaptations in a dynamic process of unpredictable climatic variability
and continuous human interactions with the natural environment in
dryland ecosystems.
Adaptation measures were paramount to inform future actions
to ameliorate impacts of climate change and variability; this seems to
have elicited little interest from researchers going by the number of
available literatures on climate change awareness [6,7]. In addition, the
link between climate variability and household livelihood responses
are largely unexamined yet improving resilience of communities and
households to effects of climate change impacts requires understanding
of local practices [8]. There is also increasing recognition that the
traditional global study on climate change has fail to address the
local impacts and local abilities to adapt to climate change effects
with assertion that while climate change is a global phenomenon,
adaptation is site-specific issues that require site specific knowledge
and experiences. Furthermore, it was recognized that it’s not easy to
predict household climate variability impacts and adaptation strategies
at international level due to minimal standard definitions, absence
or difficulty to get benchmark data. Therefore, a strong imperative

Abstract
This study was conducted with the main objective of assessing the impacts of climate variability and households’
adaptation strategies in Laree district of Gambelia region. A cross-sectional survey of 186 respondents were used. Both
primary and secondary sources were employed. Qualitative data were analyzed by content analysis of collected data
while, quantitative data were analyzed by various descriptive statistics, general linear model univariate analysis and
multiple regression. Precipitation Concentration Index (PCI) and Rainfall coefficient (fluviometric coefficient) was used.
The result of the study has showed that almost all respondents (97%) perceived that there is high variability of elements
of climate. For instance, highest maximum temperature from 1982-2011 is 41.3°C. Laree has irregular precipitation
distribution as it has PCI of 19.71. In addition, 99.5% of participants confirmed that climate variability is affecting them
and 95% have confirmed there is high vulnerability. The result of general linear model univariate analysis revealed that
decline in livestock productivity, ecosystem damage, forced sale of productive livestock assets and out migration of able
bodied adults were significantly related with climate variability. Furthermore, the result of multiple regression revealed
that flooding, erratic rainfall, low calorie intake, high mobility and dependency on climate sensitive sector determines the
vulnerability to climate variability. In the study area 29.6% of the respondents confirmed they have very high adaptive
capacity and 38.2% of them have high adaptive capacity. The problem of climate variability would continue imposing
severe impacts on the community and community should gain awareness.

to understand the actual dynamics of climate change and variability
impact and adaptations at the lowest levels of the society, such as
households, communities and districts were suggested.
Climatic variability is already affecting many natural systems around
the world. Increases in temperature, change in precipitation patterns,
widespread melting of snow and ice, and rising global average sea level
are a common phenomenon. Some climate change is now inevitable
and there is increasing evidence that it is already happening. With early,
sustained and concerted global action to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG)
emissions can limit the changes both to climate, and to the natural
systems that maintain climate. Failure to significantly reduce emissions
may fundamentally alter the Earth’s climate system and commit future
generations to more dangerous changes and variability [6].
In the last three decades, the study area faced with frequent climatic
variability and agro-ecological change. The average annual temperature
of study district was relatively low than the current annual temperature.
These trends increase in alarming rate from time to time synergic with the
current climatic change. These changes brought about low production
and productivity in economy and social aspect of community. These
urge that there will be a need for further investigations to harmonize
live with the climate change impact by assessing different environment
friendly adaptation strategies [6]. So far there was limited study
particularly undertaken on the same problem and in the same area.
The people leaving in the study area are mostly agro-pastoralist
and they are the one who are mostly susceptible to the impacts of
climate variability. This research has tried to identify current impacts,
vulnerability condition and adaptation strategies of households in study
area. It has tried to fill the existing knowledge gap and has come up
with adaptation strategies communities in the study area are using,
in order to adjust themselves to the impacts of climate variability. To
this end, the main purpose of this study was to assess the impacts of
climate variability and household adaptation strategy in study area.
The problem has attracted the interest of the researcher because of
high variability of the system that has been affecting the community
leaving there. That was why the researchers were highly initiated in this
problem. Thus, the main objective of this study is to assess impacts of
climate variability and household’s adaptation strategies in Lare district.
Specifically intend to investigate the impacts of climate variability in
study area, assess vulnerability status of households to the impacts of
climate variability and identify adaptation strategies of households to
impacts of climate variability.
Research Methodology and Design
The study area
Gambella is one of the nine regional states that constitute the
Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia. It is located in the western tip
of the country and has common borders with Sudan in the West, South
and North, the Regional state of the SNNP in the south and East, with
The Regional state of Oromia in the North and East. Gambella is lying
between the Baro and Akobo rivers. It has an area of 25,802.01 square
km. In 2007, the Regional state has a total population of 306,916. Its
capital city is Gambella Town (CSA, 2009). Lare is one of the districts
in the Gambella Region of Ethiopia and it is part of the Nuer Zone.
It is bordered on the south and east by the Anuak Zone, on the west
by the Baro River which separates it from Jikawo, and on the north
by the Jikawo River which separates it from South Sudan. Towns in
Lare include Kowerneng. The terrain in Lare consists of marshes and
grasslands; elevations range from 300 to 400 meters above sea level. A
notable landmark is Gambela National Park, which occupies part of the
area south of the Baro.
The climate of the Region is formed under the influence of the
tropical monsoon from the Indian Ocean, which are characterized
with high rainfall in the wet period from May to October and has little
rainfall during the dry period from November to April. The mean
annual temperature of the Region varies from 17.3 to 28.3 degree
Celsius and annual monthly temperature varies throughout the year
from 27 to 33 degrees Celsius. The annual rainfall of the Region in the
lower altitudes varies from 900-1,500 mm. At higher altitudes it ranges
from 1,900-2,100 mm. The annual evapo-transpiration in the Gambella
reaches about 1,612 mm and the maximum value occurs in March and
is about 212 mm. The region endowed with a vast marginal land which
is suitable for agriculture and other economic activities. The existing
land cover (vegetation) types of the region are identified as cultivated
land, forest land, wood land, bush land, shrub land, grass land, bamboo,
wet (marsh land), etc. [6].
Research design and methods
For this study mixed concurrent triangulation research design
were applied to assess impacts of climate variability and households’
adaptation strategies. Three kebeles (Teluth, Nibnib and kengnipout)
were selected purposely for the study. The data for the study were
generated from both primary and secondary sources. To analyze
data descriptive statistics, general linear model univariate analysis
and multiple regression model were used. The climatic data obtained
from National Meteorological Agency were analyzed carefully
(i.e., Analysis of trends, patterns and distribution of rainfall and
temperature). Precipitation Concentration Index (PCI) and Rainfall
coefficient (pluviometric coefficient) was used to estimate the monthly
heterogeneity of rainfall.
Results and Discussion
The impacts of climate variability
Evidences of gradual rise in air temperature and consequent
global warming: Variability in both time and space is an inherent
feature of climate, as the atmosphere is always in state of turmoil and
instability leading to variations in weather and climatic conditions.
According to IPCC, global averaged land and ocean temperature trend
show a warming of 0.85 (0.65 to 1.06) Cover the period 1880 to 2012.
Temperatures in 2015 were about 1°C above the preindustrial era,
according to a consolidated analysis from the World Meteorological
Organization (WMO). In the study area, almost all respondents have
responded that increase of temperature (97%), warming of water
(92%), seasonal flooding (90%), spreading of tropical diseases (e.g.
malaria) (96%), change in precipitation patterns (89%) and shifting of
seasonal weather phenomena (88%) were the main evidence of impacts
of climate variability.
A closer look at the above evidences, can confirm that there is high
variability in elements of climate. The result of discussion with group
of elders, women and herds men at Nibnib, Teluth and kengnypout
areas of Lare districts has confirmed this Figure 1. Here the main focus
of discussion is whether the area is affected by the climate variability
impacts and the evidence they observed. Many of them has witnessed
that, there is impacts of climate variability and the evidence for this
are extreme temperature, livestock death, seasonal flooding as a result
of filling of Baro river and high intensity rainfall, outbreak of malaria
and other tropical diseases. Similar studies by Mary [2] also showed
that local people perceived changes in rainfall and temperature. At the

global level, some attempts have been made to overcome the impacts of
climate change and variability.
The Paris Agreement for instance, adopted in December 2015 by
the 21st Conference of the Parties (COP 21) of the United Nations
Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), aims to
maintain the increase in global temperatures well below 2 degrees
Celsius above pre-industrial levels. In addition, they make efforts to limit
it to 1.5 degrees taking into account the best available science, equity,
sustainable development, the need to ensure food security and the
availability of means of implementation, by ensuring deep reductions
in global greenhouse gas [net] emissions. Furthermore, outcome of
COP 22 in Marrakech the parties adopted 35 decisions, mostly related
to the implementation of the Paris Agreement. The decisions set 2018
as the deadline for developing a rulebook for the implementation of the
Agreement, based on transparency and accountability. Herein under,
general linear model shows how evidence of climate variability are
affected by different variables explanatory variables Table 1.
The result of general linear model univariate analysis shows the
seven variables are significantly influence climate variability in study
area. In this model 77.4% of variance in evidence of climate variability
is explained by explanatory variables. With dependent variable of
evidences of climate variability, ecosystem damage (0.000), decline in
livestock productivity (0.002), increased likelihood of forced sale of
productive assets and indebtedness (0.004), and out migration of able
bodied adults in search of off-farm employment (0.001) were pretty
much significantly influences climate variability at 1% and decline in
biological productivity (0.023) is related with the impacts of climate
variability at 5% significant level. Whereas, unsustainable exploitation
of natural resources and decreasing of soil moisture contents are
significant at 10% significant level.
Temperature variability: Temperature of the study area is highly
variable as the area fall under arid, Semi-arid and humid conditions
[6]. The Figure 1 above, depicts average max temperature data for over
30 years from 1982-2011. The recorded average maximum temperature
in study area ranges from 32.6°C to 35.5°C. Lowest maximum average
temperature has occurred in 1999 which is 32.6°C and while highest
maximum average temperature has occurred during 1982 and 2007
which is both 35.5°C. Therefore, the difference between average
maximum and average minimum temperature is 2.9°C. From 2009
to 2011 the average maximum temperature of study area has reached
35.01°C, 35.1°C and 35.4°C respectively. The lowest maximum
temperature from 1982- 2011 is 28.12°C and has occurred in August
2007 and the highest maximum temperature from 1982-2011 is 41.3°C
and has occurred March 1999. When we compare the other three
stations with Laree, Gambelia has the highest maximum temperature of
41.18°C in February 2011, I tang has the highest maximum temperature
of 40.38°C in April 2010 and Jikawo has the highest maximum
temperature of 40.79°C in April 2010. Averagely Lare has the highest
maximum temperature of all and 1999 is the hottest year all in study
area.
The above Figure 2 depicts the average minimum monthly
temperature of study area. According to the Figure 1, average lowest
minimum monthly temperature from January to December which
occurred from 1982 to 2011 is 19.26°C while highest minimum monthly
temperature is 21.9°C. Average mean annual monthly minimum
temperature is 20.3°C. On the basis of this Figure 1 the highest minimum
monthly temperature has occurred in April (21.9°C) and the lowest
minimum monthly temperature has occurred in December (19.269°C).
In addition, Figure 3 below shows sample spectral distribution function
and sample spectral density function of average maximum temperature
at Lare district.

A time series is a sequence of data points measured at successive
time intervals. It can be measured by periodogram. The periodogram
gives information about the relative strengths of the various frequencies
for explaining the variation in the time series. As it can be seen from
above periodogram, in spectral distribution function, the sense that
the value at time ‘t’ is not correlated with a value at any other time.
Hence, the spectrum is flat. The spectral density is a frequency domain
representation of a time series that is directly related to the auto
covariance time domain representation. In the following paragraph, we
have compared average minimum monthly temperatures between four
stations of Gambella region.
The Figure 4 below compare the lare average minimum monthly
temperature of 1982 to 2011 with average minimum monthly temp at
Jikawo, Itang and Gambella station. These stations are selected because
of their proximity to the study area. For instance, at Jikawo station the
lowest minimum monthly temperature from 1982 to 2011 is 19.26°C
which has occurred in months of December, while highest minimum
monthly temperature is 21.5°C and this has occurred in month of
April. Additionally, at Gambella station the lowest minimum monthly
temperature is 18.76°C which has occurred in months of August and
highest minimum monthly temperature is 21.3°C and has occurred
in March. Finally, when we see temperature of Itang station the lowest
minimum monthly temperature is 18.36°C which has occurred in
January and highest minimum monthly temperature is 21.13°C and has
occurred in April. Therefore, on the basis of these Figure 5 Lare has
highest lowest minimum temperature which is 19.269°C.
Rainfall variability: The Figure 6 below reveals the mean average
monthly rainfall of four station of Gambella region. The data shows
mean average monthly rainfall for over 32 years from 1983 to 2014.
According this data, the smallest mean average monthly rainfall at the
study area is 59 mm. This amount has occurred in 2002. This indicates
that year 2002 has got minimum amount of rainfall that affected

productivity. In correspondence, largest mean average monthly rainfall
is 146.25 mm and has occurred in 2008. Again, when we compare the
rainfall of the other three surrounding stations, Gambella has smallest
and largest mean average monthly rainfall of 87.75 mm and 149.4
mm respectively, Itang has smallest and largest mean average monthly
rainfall of 70.58 mm and 145.5 mm respectively and Jikawo has smallest
and largest mean average monthly rainfall of 70.66 mm and 141.83 mm
respectively.
Therefore, largest highest mean average monthly rainfall is highest
in Gambella followed by Laree, while Laree has lowest smallest mean
average monthly rainfall of all. Below is mean average monthly rainfall
of Lare station Figure 7. Mean belg, kiremt, Bega and annual RF at four
stations are presented in Figure 8 below.
The above Figure 8 depicts mean Belg, mean Bega, mean kiremet
and annual rainfall of the four stations of Gambella region. Belg
includes February, March, April and May. Kiremet includes June,
July, August and September, while Bega includes October, November,
December and January. Mean Belg rainfall at Lare station is 26.125 mm,
while mean kiremet and mean Bega rainfall are 187.58 mm and 80.25
mm respectively. In addition, mean annual rainfall is 98.98 mm. When
we compare mean annual rainfall of the other three stations with Lare
station, Gambella has mean annual rainfall of 117.76 mm while Itang
and Jikawo has 107.8 mm and 107.7 mm respectively. From the four
stations, Lare has lowest mean annual rainfall. Herein under, mean
monthly rainfall of four stations are presented.
The above Figure 9 depicts mean monthly rainfall at the four
stations of Gambella region. Is study area (Lare) the minimum mean
monthly rainfall recorded is 5.53 mm which has occurred in February
and maximum mean monthly rainfall is 211.6 mm and has occurred in
July. On the other hand, Gambella has minimum mean monthly rainfall
of 8.13 mm which has occurred in February and maximum mean
monthly rainfall is 218.17 mm and has occurred in August. Likewise,
Itang has minimum and maximum mean monthly rainfall of 6.06 mm
in February and 214.2 mm in July respectively. Whereas, Jikawo has
minimum and maximum mean monthly rainfall of 6.06 mm in February
and 212.76 mm in August respectively. Compared to the others Lare
has lowest maximum and minimum mean temperature. This condition
exacerbates the variability of rainfall in study. Analysis of discussions
with FGD also confirms that there is the highest variability in elements
of weather and climate like rainfall and temperature. Figure 10 depicts
mean monthly rainfall of Lare station, while Table 2, shows PCI and
pluviometric coefficient for Lare Woreda from to see the distributions
and irregularity of rainfall in study area.
The above table depicts the computation of PCI and pluviometric
coefficient for Lare Woreda from (1983- 2014). As it has been shown
above the precipitation concentration index (PCI) of Lare Woreda
from 1983- 2914 is 19.71. According to Oliver [9] (i) PCI < 10 indicates
uniform precipitation distribution (low precipitation concentration),
(ii) PCI >11 and <15 indicates moderate precipitation concentration;
(iii) PCI >16 and < 20 indicates irregular distribution, and (iv) PCI > 20

Therefore, on the basis of this, Lare Woreda has irregular precipitation

study by Birhanu [10] in Misrak Badawacho Woreda, SNNPR, which
have PCI of 17.296.
Furthermore, according to Monkhouse and Wilkinson 1971,
Birhanu [10] using pluviometric coefficient signifies values between
0.6 and 1 show low concentration, values 1 to 2 indicate medium
concentration while values 2 to 3 show high concentration and the
value greater than 3 represents very high concentration of attribute.
Pluviometric coefficient calculates any month at a given weather
station the ratio of the monthly normal precipitation to one-twelfth
of the annual normal precipitation. Thus, on the basis of this January,
February, March, April, May, September, October, November and
December has very low concentration of rainfall. On the other hand,
June, July and August has medium concentration of rainfall. Therefore,
we can understand from this computation of PCI and pluviometric
coefficient that, there is high rainfall variability [11-13].
Impacts and extent of climate variability
The researchers have tried to ask the respondents about the evidences
and impacts of climate variability in study area. According to the study
by Halkano and James [1] among the Gadamoji Agro-Pastoralists
of Marsabit County, Kenya, knowledge of people’s perceptions is
paramount to inform future actions to ameliorate impacts of climate
changes. In the study area 97.8% of the community perceived that there
is evidence for the impacts of climate variability. In support with this
figure discussion with elders, women and local leaders of the three
kebeles has confirmed that, there is usually flooding, high temperature,
incidence of tropical disease like malaria. So, these are the globally
agreed evidence and impacts of climate variability. In support to this
99.5% of them again confirmed that high variability in the system is
affecting them. Halkano and James [1] showed that local people are
aware of rainfall and temperature variability and its impacts on their
livelihood [14-18].

Extent of impact of climate variability: Study area experience high
impacts of climate variability and change. On the basis of this study,
22% of respondents confirmed that there is a very high decrease in
precipitation pattern, 44.1% and 2.7% of them confirmed that there
is high and very low decrease in rainfall respectively. Again 8.1% of
respondent’s states there is a very high increase in surface temperature,
while 34.9% of them stated it as high, 41.9% of them confirmed that,
increase in surface temperature is medium and only 5.4% of them
responded there is very low increase in surface temperature of study
area. Therefore, decrease in precipitation (rainfall) (22%) have very
high extents of impacts followed by dependency on food relief and
remittances (14.5%) and decreased crop yields and shorten the growing
season (14%). In correspondence with this, decrease in precipitation
(rainfall) (44.1%), decrease in soil moisture content (38.7%), ecosystem
damage (35.5%) and increasing of surface temperature (34.9%) have the
highest impacts in study area. Analysis of discussion with community
at large supports this idea. Perceptions of respondents on the other
impacts of climate variability can be seen from Table 3 below.
Vulnerability to the impacts of climate variability
Almost all of the respondents (95%) have responded study area is
vulnerable to the impacts of climate variability. Vulnerability can vary by
place and people [19-23]. According to people who live on arid or semiarid
lands, in low-lying coastal areas, in water limited or flood-prone
areas, or on small islands are particularly vulnerable to climate change
and variability. Discussion with key informants and FGD confirmed
that, study area is found in lowland and flood prone area and rainfall
variability and temperature is very extreme. These factors make the area
most vulnerable to the impacts of climate variability. Vulnerability to
the impacts of climate variability can be seen as biophysical and social
vulnerability. Herein under Table 4 depicts the results of multiple
regression on vulnerability.
In the above model p-value is 0.0000. This indicates the reliability of
independent variables to predict dependent variable. As it can be seen
from the model there is statistically significant relationship between
dependent and explanatory variables. In this model 73% of variance
in vulnerability is explained by explanatory variables. At the 95% of
significance five variables significantly explains the vulnerability in
climate system. These are flooding (0.000), erratic rainfall (0.043), low
calorie intake (0.000), high mobility (0.054) and dependency on climate
sensitive sector (0.012). Flooding and low-calorie intake provides very
significant evidence against vulnerability of community to the impacts
of climate variability. Particularity those people who live nearby Barro
river are highly vulnerable because of flooding. Flooding may occur
whenever there is rainfall of high intensity. In addition, community
perceived there is low calorie intake because of lack of adequate food
which leads may households to relief aid. This statistical significance is
supported by view of discussion with community. Vulnerability of the
community to impacts of climate variability is also highly determined
by dependency on climate sensitive sector. For instance, community
in study area are partly agro-pastoralist and livestock sector are highly
vulnerable to the impacts of climate variability. In correspondence,
vulnerability of study area is determined by occurrence of erratic and
unreliable rainfall. It is a result of this unreliability that leads to flooding
of coastal areas of Barro river and other areas as high intensity rainfall
occurs. Finally, there is high mobility of pastoralist sector. Particularly
mobile pastoralist community are high vulnerable to the impacts of
climate variability.
Biophysical vulnerability: The respondents were asked the degree
of biophysical vulnerability to the impacts of climate variability in
the study area. As it can be seen from Table 5 below, perception of
community on the degree of biophysical vulnerability shows that,
there is high flooding (40.5%), soil erosion (38.7%), decline in water

quality (37.6%), and prolonged drought (25.8%). The discussion with
community members agreed the same issues. Therefore, one can
understand there is very high vulnerability of natural resource of the
area. Particularly soil and water resources are impaired as a result of
climate variability in the area.
Social vulnerability: It is clear that climate has affected, affecting
and will affects many parts of the world. If society are persistently
disturbing the climatic system and elements, climate will continue to
influence different sectors negatively. Vulnerability to the impacts of
climate variability varies by region, people and place of living. In line
with this, social vulnerability includes health, resilience of community
to different climatic hazards and etc. In study area community has
confirmed that there is a high health problem (51.6%) which includes
high incidence of malaria (48.9%) and respiratory disease (36%).
Furthermore, the area is again vulnerable to the low-calorie intake
(29.6%), high mobility (28.5%) and resilience to flooding hazards
(26.9%) [24].
Adaptation practices of households to climate variability
According to IPCC in 2007, adaptive capacity is “the ability of
a system to adjust to climate change (including climate variability
and extremes) to moderate potential damages, to take advantage of
opportunities, or to cope with the consequences.” In the study area 29.6%
of the respondents confirmed they have very high adaptive capacity.
This means that this portion of the community have high ability to
cope with the impacts of climate variability. 38.2% of respondents again
witnessed that, they have high adaptive capacity, and are able to react
or cope swiftly and easily to the effects of climate variability and are
again less vulnerable and more resilient. Whereas again 24.7% and 7.5%
of respondent’s wittiness they have medium and low adaptive capacity
respectively. Especially those communities found in flood prone areas
nearby Barro River and poor households are highly vulnerable to the
impacts of climate variability and less able to cope with adverse impacts.
A can be seen from Table 6, below the study found the adaptation
mechanisms for which respondents have very great extent of adaptation
are Low return activity participation (Fuel wood selling) (15.1%), Plant
Early Maturing and Drought Tolerant Seeds (14.5%) and Diversify
Herd Composition (14%). This means only few of them participated
in these adaptation mechanisms. This due to lack of awareness and
majority of those who sale fuel woods are highlanders and practice
of planting early maturing species are also not well known in the area
as many of them are pastoralist and agro-pastoralist. To deal with the
adverse shock of climate variability 50.5% of respondents plant early
maturing and drought tolerant seeds, followed by those who depend
on low return activity participation (Casual labor) (33.3%) and sale
milk or crop produces (32.8%). The extent of adaptation to most
respondents is medium. For instance, a good proportion of households
(48.9%) have an adoption of drought-tolerant livestock species example
goats. Majority of them (48.4%) adjust Planting time. This is because
during the onset of rainfall there is high flooding as the result of

high intensity rainfall, planting is undertaken some weeks later after
seasonal flooding. To refrain from engulfment of Baro River which
cause seasonal flooding, community relay growing season so that, they
can cultivate after flooding. Moreover, parts of the households practice
soil conservation measures (46.8%) and engage in non-farm activities
(45.2%). Soil conservation measures are as the part of government plan
for integrated watershed management. 40.9% of households’ relay on
food aid, remittances and other external supports. This is particularly
very common is the study area during the time of natural and other
calamities.
Similar study by Dual in 2013 showed, that Karey pastoralist uses
diversification of herds and incomes to adapt to the impacts of climate
variability. Dual added for instance, community shifts to drought
tolerant livestock species like goat and camels in Karey pastoralist and
this was the case for the study are except for camel [25-35].
Conclusion
The result of the study has showed that almost all respondents
perceive that there are high variability of climate and this variability
in climate have been imposing and would continue to impose negative
impacts on the community. The result of general linear model
univariate analysis has showed ecosystem damage, decline in biological
productivity, decline in livestock productivity, increased likelihood of
forced sale of productive assets and indebtedness and out migration
able bodied adults in search of off-farm employment are pretty much
significant impacts of climate variability in study area.
Furthermore, given PCI of 19.17 Laree have an irregular and
uneven rainfall distribution which leads to low concentration of rainfall
in some months and medium concentration of rainfall in others.
Study area is highly vulnerable to the impacts of climate variability as
area is found in lowland and flood prone area and rainfall variability
temperature extremes are very high. To react or cope swiftly and easily
to the effects of climate variability richest portion of community have
high adaptive capacity while those living nearby Barro river and poor
household have low adaptive capacity and are highly vulnerable to
the impacts of climate variability. The extent of adaptation to most
respondents is medium. For instance, a good proportion of households
have an adoption of drought-tolerant livestock species example goats,
adjusting of planting time, practicing soil conservation measures,
engaging in non-farm activities and relaying on food aid, remittances
and other external supports are adaptation strategies of households in
Laree Woreda.
Recommendations
There are high impacts of climate variability and high biophysical
and social vulnerability to impacts of climate variability in study area.
Therefore, the following recommendations are made for the future
interventions by the researchers.
• Community should gain awareness on climate change and
variability so that they can clearly understand its impacts.
In correspondence, communities should be sensitized to
understand their levels of vulnerability and design sustainable
adaptation action plans.
• Climate change and variability issues should be mainstreamed
at all levels through working with policy makers, development
agencies, research institutions, regional government and the
media.
• There should be focused initiative, institutionalized and
collaborative framework (e.g. public-private partnership) to
strengthen adaptive capacity of households.
• Increase access to climate information, financial services, levels
of literacy and improve social infrastructures to build local
adaptive capacities in the study area should be improved.
• Regional government and NGOs in the area should make
community get access to the experiences of other area which are
vulnerable to the impacts of climate variability so that they can
learn how to cope more and increase their adaptive capacity
• Adaptation strategies like diversifying of herd composition,
reducing of herd number (destocking), fodder preservation (e.g.
enclosure), partial shift to other livelihoods, credit from betteroffs
and local institutions, adoption of drought-tolerant livestock
species example goats, adjusting of planting time, practicing of
soil conservation measures and engaging in non-farm activities
should be strengthened.
