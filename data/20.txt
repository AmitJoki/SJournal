Abstract
Endangered species are strictly contraband within the world of high fashion couture but not for marine
fashionistas. During recent surveys a decorator crab (Hyastenus sp.) was found exclusively covered in a thick coat
of the critically endangered marine brown alga, Nereia lophocladia. This marine alga is among only a few to be
globally listed as critically endangered and protected by legislation. While decorator crabs are widely known to adorn
themselves in algae and other organisms for defense and camouflage, this is the first documented occurrence of
critically endangered couture.

Introduction
Decorator crabs are perhaps best defined for covering themselves in
algae, anemones, sponges and other organisms for defence as well as
cDmouflDge [1,2]. During recent surveys, however, a specimen of the
decorator crab (Hyastenus sp.) was found almost exclusively covered in
Nereia lophocladia (J. Agardh), a marine brown alga that is listed as
critically endangered under Part 7A of the Fisheries Management Act
1994 in New South Wales (NSW) Australia. ?is species has an
extremely limited distribution Co??s Harbour, NSW, Australia) and its
habitat, within its only known location, has been altered due to the
construction of a breakwater [3,4]. It remains among only a few species
of marine algae globally that are listed and protected by threatened
species legislation. Until recently, N. lophocladia was thought to be
“extinct” because surveys failed to find it over a 13-year period.
However, it was found again in 2015 during surveys to assess potential
impacts of breakwater upgrade works in its only known habitat [5,6].
?e decorator crab was found within a rare, dense patch of N.
lophocladia and its carapace, legs and rostrum were almost exclusively
covered in tu?ed-Dpices of N. lophocladia (Figure 1a).
?e crab had collected ~20 pieces of the algae, which had been cut
o?? below the tu? of apical filDments, and attached to the hooked setae
covering its body (Figure 1b). ?e fragments of N. lophocladia were
visibly alive with no obvious signs that removal had impacted their
viability. ?e crab had also collected one small piece of unidentified
filDmentous red algae (Figure 1a).

critically endangered Nereia lophocladia and (b) how the tu?ed
apices of N. lophocladia had been cut o?? for attachment.
It is interesting to speculate whether the crab may act as a vector for
dispersal of fertile N. lophocladia material. 7u?ed axes bearing
reproductive unilocular sporangia were observed on nearby plants

Short Communication
Critically Endangered Algal Couture
collected at the same time [7] indicating that populations were fertile.
Movement of crabs decorated with N. lophocladia into other algal
habitats may promote the establishment of new and discrete patches.
Furthermore, translocation of N. lophocladia by crabs could represent
a pathway of gene flow that may otherwise not exist given the spatial
and temporal scarcity of this species. Genetic analyses could inform
dispersal pathways [8] and any role played by decorator crabs.
?e reason behind this unique association is unknown but
intriguing. Hyastenus sp. are regionally known to also cover themselves
with sponges and gorgonian tissue so are not specialist algal
decorators. It may be that N. lophocladia contains deterrent chemicals
that the crab uses for defence against predators or that the alga may
simply be used for cDmouflDge. What is certain, is that the association
is spatially and temporally variable [9], due to the restricted
distribution of the alga relative to the crab and the absence of N.
lophocladia sporophytes in the Austral summer and autumn.
Unravelling the mechanisms behind this association will elucidate the
ecological role played by this rare alga and, combined with an
improving understanding of N. lophocladia biology, will help shape
future conservation plans for this critically endangered species.
