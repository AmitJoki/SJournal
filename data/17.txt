Introduction
Pinch analysis can increase the energy efficiencies of individual
chemical processes. It has established itself as a highly versatile tool
for process design. Originally pioneered as a technique for reducing
the energy costs of new plants, it was later adapted for retrofits [1].
Pinch analysis quickly proposes good ideas for heat integration during
complex processes, e.g. by using a grand-composite curve. A combined
heat and power design adds degrees of freedom to the optimisation
method.
Pinch techniques are used within the chemical industry for
improving heat integration regarding utility systems. Ahmad and Hui
[2] extended the concept for direct and indirect integration. Using
site-source and site-sink profiles, the targets for steam generation
and utilisation between processes were set by Dhole and Linnhoff
[3]. Hui and Ahmad [4] developed a procedure for the optimum cost
integrations of different processes using exergetic steam costing.
Over the last four decades, the problem of designing and
synthesizing optimal HENs (heat exchanger networks) has been the
focus of an extensive number of studies [5,6]. In regard to this problem,
a set of hot streams at a set of initial (stream) temperatures needs to
be cooled in order to correspond to a set of target temperatures, and
a set of cold streams at a set of initial (stream) temperatures needs to
be heated to another corresponding set of target temperatures. The
objective is to determine the structure of the HEN and associated heat
exchanger (HEX) heat load/duty (I), together with additional heaters
and coolers (utilities), if required. This brings all streams to their
target temperatures provided that the HEN’s and HEX’s input and

Abstract
Pinch analysis is a very useful method that can increase the energy efficiencies of individual chemical processes
including simultaneous heat integration and process optimisation. Pinch analysis is based on constant heat capacity
flow (CF) for each stream. In regard to greater temperature differences of more than 200 K, the heat capacity flow
could be corrected using a quantified maximal possible correction factor (fcor) obtained from practical experience. This
is because of certain determined changes in specific heat capacity (cp
), as it is temperature dependent. The correction
factor for heat capacity flow is calculated by determining the errors of specific heat capacities. This technique includes
those specific heat capacity errors during significant temperature differences that cause errors regarding heat capacity
flow. The correction factor could be reduced by using the calculated mistake of heat flow rate during integrated networks.
The novelty of this paper is the correction factor, which could be:
• Obtained from practical experience
• Reduced the mistake of heat flow rate
• Reduced the energy loss.

output temperature differentials are greater than or equal to the HEN
minimum temperature-differential approach (?Tmin) [6].
A heat exchanger network’s design may depend on the heat-pinch
targeting stage, as an approach whereby hot and cold composite curves
(CCs) are used for determining the heat energy targets (heat recovery,
cold utility, and hot utility) at a specified minimum temperature
differential ?Tmin [7]. The targeting stage allows the designer of HENs
to determine the best performance achievable prior to actual synthesis.
Energy targets may be set using CCs, where the minimum hot and cold
utilities’ requirements are determined.
Over past decades, pinch analysis techniques have been used for the
systematic designing of heat recovery and material conservation systems
[8], and within process plants [9]. In particular, pinch analysis is widely
used within the area of resource conservation, such as the recoveries
of solvents [8], water [10,11], utility gas [12,13], and property-based
integration [14,15]. This family of techniques is complementary to
mathematical optimisation techniques, as they offer advantages with
respect to problem analysis and visualisation. In addition, they also
provide useful insights and performance targets for facilitating the
subsequent detailed design stage.
Sometimes different correction factors are used that are inserted

within the models. An equation of state is a thermodynamic equation
that relates two or more state functions (temperature, pressure, volume
etc.) in order to describe the properties of fluids and their mixtures.
The use of cubic equations of state (CEOS) became popular during
the modelling of natural gas systems in the 1970s because of their
remarkable prediction regarding the phase behaviour of hydrocarbon
fluids. Gopal and Biegler [16] presented a phase-equilibrium
formulation that handles missing or disappearing phases, and can be
extended for incorporating cubic equations of state (CEOS) within a
thermodynamic model. It shows that the derivative constraints for the
CEOS can be relaxed using the same slack variables that handle the
missing phases. Kamath et al. [17] proposed a new general equationoriented
(EO) approach for selecting the appropriate root of the cubic
equation of state (CEOS) by incorporating those derivative constraints
specific to the desired (vapour or liquid) phase.
A new equation-oriented process model for multi-stream heat
exchangers (MHEX) is presented with special emphasis on handling
phase changes. This model internally uses the pinch concept in order
to ensure minimum driving force criteria. Streams capable of phase
change are split into sub-streams corresponding to each of the phases
[18].
Heat integration of efficient energy plays an important role within
process industries, therefore it is very important to include correction
factors within the industrial models. This paper presents a technique
for the estimation of a correction factor for specific heat capacity where
heat integration is performed over very high temperature differences of
more than 200 K.
Methods and Results
Estimating the maximal possible correction factor within
pinch analysis as obtained from practical experience
The quantified maximal possible correction factor (fcor) estimation
for heat capacity flow within pinch analysis could be determined using
a specific heat capacity during greater temperature differences of more
than 200 K. This correction factor is used for correcting the heat capacity
flow used during pinch heat integration. All the basic principles and
rules of pinch analysis remain the same.
Pinch analysis treats the streams as a whole and calculates the heat
capacity flows (CF) of streams. The basic principles of pinch analysis do
not consider the phase changes of individual streams particularly and
are, therefore not the principle correction factors that take over all the
rules of pinch analysis. In the case of a stream’s division into multiple
streams, these correction factors would only be used if the temperature
difference were greater than 200 K. A temperature difference of about
50 K does not cause any errors of CF, therefore it does not need any
corrections. The correction factor would only be used if the temperature
differences were greater than 200 K.
Pinch analysis is a methodology for minimising the energy
consumptions of chemical processes by calculating thermodynamicallyfeasible
energy targets, and achieving them by optimising heat recovery
systems, energy supply methods, and process operating conditions.
The basic equation of pinch analysis is equation number 1, which
presents the heat flow rate (F) that depends on the specific heat
capacity at a constant pressure for components (cp
), mass flow (qn
), and
temperature difference ?T [1,19].
p n F = · ·? = ·? c q T CF T (1)
The product of specific heat capacity at a constant pressure of
components (cp
) and mass flow (qn
), denotes the heat capacity flow (CF)
that is constant for each stream [1]. CF shows a slope for the function of
the heat flow rate (F) and the temperature difference (?T).
These data (F, ?T and CF) are combined for all the streams within
the plant for providing composite curves, one for all hot streams
(releasing heat) and one for all cold streams (requiring heat). The point
of the closest approach between the hot and cold composite curves is
the pinch point (or just pinch) with a hot stream pinch temperature and
a cold stream pinch temperature. These data (F, ?T and CF) are the
bases for determining all the characteristics of pinch analysis, therefore,
it is necessary to prevent any errors, especially when determining the
heat capacity flow (CF):
CF =F ?/ T (2)
The determination of CF can cause errors but only under greater
temperature differences of more than 200 K because of certain
determined changes in specific heat capacity (cp
). The specific heat
capacity is defined as the heat required to raise one unit mass of
substance by one degree of temperature, therefore it is temperature
dependent. The specific heat capacity is the measurable physical
quantity that characterises the amount of heat required to change a
substance's temperature by a given amount. The correction factor does
not include the impact of fluid turbulence.
Estimating a correction factor
For a stream with a high ?T of more than 200 K, the calculated heat
capacity flow (CF) obtained by using equation 2 is inaccurate, therefore
the calculated CF could be corrected using the maximal possible
correction factor (fcor, in W/K), especially, if the total heat flow rate of
this stream splits into smaller parts:
cor cor CF CF = ± f (3)
A correction factor provides the calculation of error (Ei
) for the heat
capacity flow under greater temperature differences of more than 200
K. Figure 1 presents all the basic characteristics of the correction factor,
including any necessary new parameters and graphical design. The
calculated CF coincides with a value of about half of the temperature
difference (?T/2) (Figure 1). The maximal errors (Emax) have to be
specially calculated at the left and right sides of the temperature intervals
(Figure 1). The Emax on the left side from the calculated CF (equation
2) is negative and positive on the right side from the calculated CF.
The total temperature interval (?T) is divided into lower temperature
intervals for a lower value of about ?Ti
 = 50°
C (or smaller) because a
temperature difference of about 50 K does not cause any errors of CF.
For each temperature interval (i=1,…I) the specific heat capacity
(cp,i) has to be determined and then the differences between these
specific heat capacities (?cp,i), and then their specific heat capacity
changes of one degree of temperature (cp-T,i), are calculated:
p T,i= / p,i i c cT -?? ,... i=1 I (4)
The maximal specific heat capacity change by one degree of
temperature (cp-T,max in J/kgK2
) is selected, which is then multiplied by
the mass flow (qn
), and so gives the maximal error (Emax in W/K2
):
E T max p ,max n =- · c q (5)
The left maximum error (-Emax in W/K2
) and on the right the
maximum error (Emax in W/K2
) can be calculated (Figure 1), having
the same quantities but different signs. Through three important points

(Emax, the calculated CF, Emax; Figure1), a line with a known linear
function Ei (equation 6) can be drawn by using the two points (Ei
= -Emax
, ?Ti
= 0), and (Ei
=+Emax, ?Ti
= Tmax). The Ei
 errors denote the different
errors between the limits of the left (-Emax) and right maximal errors
(+Emax):
i i E T = ·? + k n (6)
Constant k determines the slope of the line and constant n
determines the y-intercept.
The correction factor is determined by using equation 7
cor i i i i f = ·? = ·? + ·? ET T T (k n) (7)
The correction factor can be calculated by using equation 7 as
a function of the temperature difference (?Ti
), and by the known
parameters of k and n.
This method can calculate the correction factor, which is then used
to correct heat capacity flow during pinch heat integration, without
changing the basic principles and rules of pinch analysis.
Case study
The idea for this method was spawned within an existing methanol
production plant, where deviation took place between the estimated
and real integration mass flow rates.
The low-pressure methanol process, as in this case study, is composed
of three subsystems:
• Production of synthesis gas
• Production of crude methanol
• Purification of methanol, which is not presented
All the subsystems were optimised, except the synthesis gas
production (only one non-optimal subsystem heating of the natural gas
and cooling of the synthesis gas (Figure 2 and Table 1).
The raw material was natural gas, which was heated-up in a steam
reformer (REA-1), where synthesis gas was produced from natural gas
and steam at 825°
C and 15 bar (Figure 2).

The hot-stream of synthesis gas was cooled within an E107 boiler,
in the E109, E110, E111 heat-exchangers with an EA101 air-cooler,
and in an E112 water-cooler. The condensate was expanded in flashes:
F1, F2, F107, and F108. All the condensates were collected (K1—K5)
during the process.
The process shown in Figure 2 was optimised very well, except for
only one non-optimal subsystem, for the heating of the natural gas and
the cooling of the synthesis gas (Table 1). This subsystem included an
existing stream E109-c with a very significant temperature difference.
The need for factoring the correlation was started after integration
of the existing stream E109-c with the EA101 stream because there was
insufficient heat flow rate.
The existing stream E109-c had a large temperature difference
(?T=400 K). The calculated CF caused inaccurate values for real
problems if the heat flow rate of E109-c was integrated within several
parts. The calculated CF for the existing stream E109-c was corrected
by a correction factor.
Integration using calculated CF
The hot and cold streams of the existing synthesis gas process are
presented in Table 1. Integration was carried out after all the parameters

(F, ?T and CF) were known. The calculated heat capacity flow rate of
the stream E109-c (CF) by using equation 2 was 8309 W/K. This stream
was integrated within the hot streams EA101 for 897.4 kW and partly
with E109-h for 2426.3 kW, by using ?Tmi =20°C (Figure 3).
Integration by using corrected CF
The total temperature interval (?T=400 K) of stream E109-c
was divided into lower temperature intervals for a rounder lower
value (?Ti
=50°
C; Figure 4). For each temperature interval (i=1,…8)
the specific heat had to be a determined capacity (cp,i) and then the
difference between these specific heat capacities (?cp,i) and those
specific heat capacities that had changed by one degree of temperature
(cp-T,i) was calculated by using equation 4. The maximal specific heat
capacity changed by one degree of temperature (cp-T,max) was 3.52 J/kgK2
(Figure 4). The mass flow (qn
) of E109-c was 2.9241 kg/s. The maximal
error (Emax) was 10.30 W/K2
 by using equation 5. E109-c was divided at
?Ti
 to 108 K because this was the first possible temperature difference
for integration with EA101 (Figure 3).
The linear function of errors (Ei
 in W/K2
, equation 6) was obtained
by using two points (Ei
= - 10.3, ?Ti
=0 K), and (Ei
= 10.3, ?Ti
= 400 K):
i i i ET T = ·? + ·? - k n=0.0515 10.3 (8)
The correction factor for E109-c was determined by using equation
7:
cor i i f = ·? = · - · =- E T (0.0515 108 10.3) 108 511.7W/K (9)
The calculated heat capacity flow rate of the stream E109-c (CF) was
8309 W/K and the new remaining correct CFcor was 7797.3 W/K:
cor cor CF CF = ±= - = f 8309 511.7 7797.3W/K (10)
The difference between the calculated CF and the corrected CFcor was
6%. New integration was performed by using the corrected (CFcor). The
cold E109-c stream was integrated with EA101 for 842 kW and partly
with E109-h for 2481.7 kW at ?Tmin = 20° C, by using the correction
factor (Figure 5). The integration heat flow rate (F) between E109-c
and EA101 was 897.4 kW when using conventional pinch analysis. The
integration heat flow rate (F) between E109-c and EA101 was 842 kW
when using the correction factor. The heat flow rate calculated after the
correction factor was comparable with the real retrofit.
This was confirmed by using practical experience that the correction
factor was only required when ?T was greater by more than 200 K
because the errors (Ei
) were becoming greater. Thereby, the optimal
lengths for the temperature intervals (?Topt) could be determined
that did not require correction. The optimal length of the temperature
intervals (?Topt) could be determined by using a graphical method
(Figure 6). The left and right maximum errors (Emax) were halved to the
linear line (Ei
) and thereby denoted the points A and B. All temperature
intervals between points A and B were summed and determined an
optimal length for the temperature intervals (?Topt) of about 200 K.
Thus also providing that errors (Ei
) were no greater than 5 W/K2
.
Conclusion
The correction factor obtained from practical experience can
reduce heat integration errors within a pinch analysis method. Pinch
analysis does not guarantee a global optimum solution but it quickly
proposes good ideas for heat integration during the process, therefore
the accuracy and reliability of this method is even more important.
The correction factor allows for quick adjustments of the heat capacity
flow. This correction factor includes maximal specific heat capacity
error during a significant temperature difference of more than 200 K,
which causes errors regarding heat capacity flow. This correction factor
reduces these errors and thus allows for better integration, which is
highly comparable with the real data. This correction factor could be
