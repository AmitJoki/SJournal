Introduction
In the context of construction industry, ‘ergonomics’ means:
‘designing the various construction tasks; providing tools, equipment,
and materials; and organizing the work to promote worker safety
and health’. A practical ergonomics program must approach both
the worker as well as the job to match each other. The work methods,
equipment and tools design must match the physical and mental
capacity of workers, and the environment: noise, temperature, and
illumination must be designed to avoid twisting, and bending of
body parts. In recent years, there has been a significant increase in the
reported cases of ergonomic disorders in the workplace. The Bureau of
Labor Statistics [1] reported that the number of disorders associated
with repeated trauma nearly doubled in 10 years from 1986 to 1996.
The possible causes of this increase can be attributed to the following:
a) A few decades ago, the trades were not strictly bounded - most
jobs included a variety of activities: a carpenter, for example,
would carry materials and clean the floor. These activities
involved footwork and movement of other body parts. With
the development of specialty trades concept, trades now use
the same body part over and over again resulting in physical
fatigue and cumulative trauma of heavily used body part(s).
b) Worker population is aging, and
c) Body parts are getting tired - no job rotation.
Work-Related Musculoskeletal Disorders (WMSDs)
Work-Related Musculoskeletal Disorders (WMSDs) are the
health disorders arising from repeated stress to the body due to
ergonomic hazards or risk factors. WMSDs develop gradually over
a period of weeks, months, or years. They include damage to the
tendons, bones, muscles, and nerves of the hands, wrists, elbows,
shoulders, necks. Backs and legs. Some of the more frequently
occurring ergonomic disorders include: low-back pain, carpal tunnel
syndrome (CTS), hearing loss, and tendonitis. WMSDs represent
1 in 3 lost time injuries (LTIs) in construction [2]. Characteristics
of work-related musculoskeletal disorders (WMSDs) are compared
with Occupational Injuries, below:
Work-related musculoskeletal disorders (WMSD) vs.
occupational injuries
Work-Related Musculoskeletal Disorders (WMSDs), also called
Cumulative Trauma Disorders (CTDs), are the results of cumulative
trauma. The occupational injuries, on the other hand, are the result
of instantaneous events in the work environment. Figure 1 shows the
differences between the occupational injuries and WMSDs. By their
very nature, WMSDs when reported pose several problems to the
employer, the health care provider, and the insurance company:
a) They could be fully, or partially psychophysical. Poor worker
supervisor relationship, lack of interest (apathy) in work,
monotonous or boring jobs, or other job-related frustrations
may trigger pains in neck or back.

Abstract
Construction expenditures at 1.22 trillion in 2017, accounted for 6.29% of the U.S. GDP, and the construction
industry employed 6.80 million, 5.34% of the total work force, that suffered 6.43% of the worksite injuries. Worker
fatalities were 19.1% of the total fatalities, 3.6 times more than all other industries. A study of the 1,657 construction
injuries and illnesses that occurred at the US Navy Public Works Center (Pearl), from 1987 to 1994, showed that 589
(36%) of the injuries were work-related musculoskeletal disorders (WMSDs). This real field data of 589 ergonomic
injuries identified following nine ergonomic risk factors: (i) Frequent or heavy lifting, (ii) Fixed or awkward body
postures, (iii) Pushing, pulling, and carrying heavy objects, (iv) Work methods, (v) Hand tools and equipment, (vi)
Repetitive, forced, or prolonged exertions, (vii) Noise, (viii) Whole body vibration, and (ix) Personnel relations This
paper has provided the effects of risk factors on the parts-of-body of construction workers, which include: low back,
shoulder, knee, hip, neck, wrist, and fingers. Also, the causal relationships between each risk factor and work-related
musculoskeletal disorder (WMSD) have been included. Some example construction occupations that suffer from
each risk factor have been shown.
Section on Ergonomic Risk Controls includes three categories: (i) Engineering controls that include: work station
design to fit all size of workers, and work method design to minimize static, extreme, and awkward postures, and to
reduce repetitive movements and excessive forces, (ii) Administrative controls to provide rest breaks for recovery
from fatigue, and job rotation to avoid using the same body part over and over, and (iii) Work practice controls,
such as: keeping tools properly maintained, using low vibration tools, and storing heavy loads at waist height.
Several other preventive measures have been mentioned, and a model construction ergonomics program has been
suggested.

b) MSDs may not be work-related. They might be the result of
other activities at home, in sports, or at other private and
uninsured jobs.
c) They can be the result of normal degenerative process of: aging,
and/or genetics; or might be the cause of some underlying (preexisting)
condition(s).
d) They could be completely non-existent; and might be reported
with fraudulent intention, such as: back ache, head ache,
etc. Most of such cases cannot be diagnosed instantly and
definitively.
e) Occasional ‘pains and aches of life’ can cause MSDs or
symptoms of MSDs.
Common WMSDs affecting construction workers
The 1988 Occupational Health Supplement to the National
Interview survey [3] compiled data from 30,074 non-institutionalized
civilians, the survey statistics show that the construction workers
experience about twice the rates of back pain and hand discomfort both
due to injury and cumulative trauma, as compared to workers in other
industries. In the construction industry, 17.4% of the carpenters, 25.5%
of the masons and 19.2% of the roofers suffer from back pain. 20.2% of
the carpet layers, 47.5% of steel workers and 23.8% of the plumbers and
pipe fitters suffer severe hand discomfort, and 6.7% of the plumbers and
pipe fitters and 7.1% of electricians suffer from back pain. Exposure to
ergonomic risk factors stresses the affected body parts of the workers
and contributes to the development of work-related musculoskeletal
disorders (WMSDs). Construction workers are exposed to several risk
factors. Identifying the ergonomic risk factors on a worksite is easy
with some training and experience and should be done for designing
work methods to prevent WMSDs. The following types of ergonomic
injuries occur in construction:
•	 Muscle Pain
•	 Joint Pain
•	 Swelling
•	 Numbness
•	 Repetitive Stress Injury
•	 Repetitive Motion Injury
•	 Restricted Motion
U.S. Navy PWC (Pearl) Statistics
US Navy Public Works Center (PWC Pearl) consulted with the
author of this paper, in 1995, to suggest solutions to the increasing
number of accidents at their PWC Pearl worksites. The various data
on ergonomic injuries presented in this paper, are based on the actual
injuries, 1657 in number that occurred at the U.S. Navy work sites. U.S.
Navy data included the following items [4]:
• Date of Injury
• Occupation of the injured worker
• Work center
• Body-part affected
• Lost work days
• Medical cost
• Compensation cost, and
• Narrative
This data of 1,657 worksite injuries were organized in a spread
sheet and analysed [5]. The narrative of each injury included the task
that the injured worker was engaged in at the time of accident, and
the type of injury suffered. These descriptions identified the nature of
injury: Occupational injury vs. Ergonomic injury. Table 1 shows workcenter
wise total occupational injuries, work-related musculoskeletal
disorders (WMSDs), and back injuries that occurred at the U.S. Navy
worksites. Of the 1657 Occupational injuries, WMSDs totaled 589
(36%), and Back injuries 310 (19%). These percentages match with
the construction safety literature which has reported that 33% of the
worksite injuries are ergonomic disorders, and 20% are back injuries.
Some of the results of the various analyses, performed on this real data,
are provided in this paper.
Ergonomic Risk Factors
Worksite ergonomic risk factors
‘Worksite risk factors’ are defined as: actions in the worksite,
worksite conditions, or a combination thereof that may cause or
aggravate a work-related musculoskeletal disorder (WMSD). The
following worksite risk factors have been known to cause WMSDs [6-9]:
• Repetitive, forceful, or prolonged exertions;

• Frequent or heavy lifting;
• Pushing, pulling, or carrying of heavy objects;
• Fixed or awkward body postures, for prolonged periods;
• Contact stress, or pinch stress;
• Localized or whole-body vibration;
• Cold or hot temperatures;
• Poor lighting (leading to awkward postures); and
• Noise.
These worksite risk factors can be intensified by work organization
characteristics, such as:
• Inadequate work-rest cycles,
• Excessive work pace and/or duration,
• Unaccustomed work,
• Lack of task variability,
• Machine-paced work, and
• Piece rate
Signal risk factors
It has been suggested that five specific worksite risk factors have
been most closely associated with an increased risk for the development
of WMSDs. They have been designated as ‘signal risk factors’. These
five signal risk factors include the concept of duration of exposure. It
is not the mere presence of a risk factor in the workplace that signals
a potential problem, there must be presence for some period. Daily
exposure to one of these factors during the work shift is likely to result
in a higher risk job. They are screening mechanisms to focus attention
on those jobs of greatest concern.
The signal risk factors are:
i Performance of same motion or motion pattern every few
seconds for more than two (2) hours at a time;
ii A fixed or awkward work posture for more than a total of two
(2) hours;
iii Use of vibrating or impact tools or equipment for more than a
total of two (2) hours;
iv Forceful hand exertions for more than a total of two (2) hours;
and
v Unassisted frequent or forceful manual lifting.
Table 2 shows the risk factors that caused 589 ergonomic injuries
at the U.S. Navy PWC (Pearl) worksites. Manual Materials Handling
caused 46% of the WMSDs, followed by Body Postures, which caused
21% of the WMSDs. Together, the two risk factors accounted for
67% of the WMSDs, and both are signal risk factors. Table 2 includes
average lost workdays, and average cost per WMSD, caused by the
corresponding risk factor.
Ergonomic risk factor: Part-of-body relationships
Table 3 shows the effects of risk factors on the parts of a worker’s
body. This knowledge can be very useful in planning job rotation to
evenly distribute job stress on different body parts.
Ergonomic risk factor: WMSD-occupation relationships
Table 4 extracted from several studies reported in the literature,
can be used in preventing WMSDs. A causal relationship of this
type will relate each of the construction or maintenance activities to
WMSDs and can be used in job designs, administrative actions and
work methods that would eliminate or reduce WMSDs.
Ergonomic Risk Controls
During 1992-1994, 90% of disabled older workers, aged 51 to
61 years, had MSDs [10], costing tens of billions of dollars [11], and
partially or wholly disabling thousands of construction workers.
Prevention of MSDs is therefore important. Ergonomic Risk Controls
can be divided in three categories:
1. Engineering Controls
2. Administrative Controls, and
3. Work Practice Controls
Tayyari F et al. [12] have described engineering controls to
include: (i) Workstation design to fit all size of workers, (ii) Work
method design to minimize: static, awkward and extreme postures;
reducing repetitive movements, and excessive forces, (iii) Modifying
the strength and endurance requirements of the tasks to be within
worker’s mental and physical capacities, and (iv) Ergonomically
designing tools and handles to reduce the risk of cumulative trauma
disorders (CTDs).

The administrative controls are applied to reduce the duration,
frequency and/or severity of exposures to risk factors. Brook A [13]
has stated some examples of administrative controls: (i) Provide rest
breaks to recover from work induced fatigue, (ii) Increase number of
employees assigned to a task, (iii) Use job rotation to insure the same
muscle or tendon are not used over and over, (iv) Add various tasks to
the employee’s job, and (v) Maintain the equipment and tools.
Several other areas of ergonomic risk controls have been suggested
[14]. Surveying the work area to identify potential problems, medical
information of the employees, discomfort surveys, absenteeism,
and turnover rates are some indicators of job stress. These job stress
conditions should be studied, analysed and addressed.
Training and Education to managers and workers are an effective
way to show ergonomic risks of their jobs before injuries occur. Written
ergonomic safety program that addresses preventive measures, specific
to the jobs in progress, can prevent injuries that might lead to CTDs.
An example Ergonomics Program is shown in Figure 2.
Identification of Problem Jobs
Identifying problems in a job is the first step and can prevent
WMSDs in a cost-effective manner. The identification is a three-step
process:
(a) Information for employees
The employer must give each employee exposed to any signal risk
factor: information about work-related musculoskeletal disorders
(WMSDs). Including their signs and symptoms; the worksite risk
factors that can cause or aggravate them; and ways to reduce exposure
to the worksite risk factors. The primary purpose of this requirement
is to increase employee awareness, giving them the background; they
need to recognize illnesses as well as worksite causes so they can
effectively participate in the ergonomics program in their work place.
(b) Risk factor checklists
The employer must complete job-specific risk factor checklists to
examine employee exposures in the worksite and determine whether
there are jobs which must be controlled. Two Risk Factor checklists,
one for upper extremities, and the other for back and lower extremities
should be completed.
(c) Early reporting of symptoms
It is also important that signs or symptoms of WMSDs be reported
early so they can be properly assessed and treated. This may help slow
the development of the disorder and speed the healing process. Study
of symptoms can also guide in the job method or tools improvement.
In order to ensure that this happens, employees must be aware of what
symptoms they might experience. They must also know how to report
those symptoms and to whom.
In addition, the employer must ensure that no policy or practice
that discourages early reporting is established. The design of some
incentive programs, safety competitions, or financial incentives may
have the effect of discouraging reporting, depending on how they are
implemented in the worksites. For example, providing rewards for
employees or supervisors when safe work methods are observed would
not discourage reporting. However, if employees or supervisors are given
financial bonuses if there are no OSHA recordable cases; this may have
the unintended but real effect of discouraging reporting of WMSDs.
Medical Management
Medical management of ergonomic injuries can control WMSDs
through simple steps shown in Figure 2. The primary goals of medical
management are to:
a) Eliminate or reduce musculoskeletal symptoms and conditions
associated with work-related risk factors,

ix. Personnel relations
This paper has shown the relationship between a risk factor and
the part-of-body affected. A table describes the effect of each of the risk
factors in causing a work-related musculoskeletal disorder (MSD),
and the effect of each of the risk factors on specific construction
occupations.
Ergonomic injuries can be eliminated or minimized using three
types of risk controls: (i) Engineering controls that include: work
station design to fit all size of workers, and work method design
to minimize static, extreme, and awkward postures, and to reduce
repetitive movements and excessive forces, (ii) Administrative controls
to provide rest breaks for recovery from fatigue, and job rotation to
avoid using the same body part over and over, etc., and (iii) Work
practice controls, such as: keeping tools properly maintained, using low
vibration tools, and storing heavy loads at waist height. Several other
preventive measures have been mentioned, and a model construction
ergonomics program has been suggested.

Summary and Conclusions
This paper has identified ergonomic risk factors that cause workrelated
musculoskeletal disorders (WMSDs) to construction workers.
Based on the real data of 1,657 injuries that occurred at the U.S. Navy
Public Works Center (PWC) Pearl, it was found that 589 (36%) of the
1,657 injuries were ergonomic injuries. An analysis of these ergonomic
injuries identified the following nine (9) ergonomic risk factors:
i. Frequent or heavy lifting,
ii. Fixed or awkward body postures,
iii. Pushing, pulling, and carrying heavy objects,
iv. Work methods,
v. Hand tools and equipment,
vi. Repetitive, forced, or prolonged exertions,
vii. Noise,
viii. Whole body vibration, and
