Abstract
Objective: Vertical transmission of HIV remains the second mode of infection in Benin. To study the
epidemiological aspects of HIV infection during the pregnancy at University Hospital Centre for Mother and Child
Lagoon (CHU-MEL).
Patients and methods: We conducted a descriptive cross-sectional study at the Mother and Child Hospital in
Benin from 1 January 2015 to 30 June 2017. The sampling was exhaustive. The selection criteria were: all pregnant
or parturient seropositive who were taken care of during the study period at HOMEL. The data analysis was done
with the Epi Info software, by calculating averages and standard deviations.
Results and conclusion: The prevalence rate of HIV amongst pregnant women was 1.9% (188/9554). The
average age was 30 years old ± 5 years. They were married (45.6%), crafts women (67.7%), lived in a monogamous
family (60.3%) and gave birth at least once (73.8%). The prevalence rate varied depending on the level of
education; it was lower among the unschooled (17.5%), around (7.4%) among those who went to high school and
higher among those with an intermediate level of education. HIV prevalence remains stable in the population of
pregnant women. The education of young girls and the increasing purchasing power of women must be taken into
consideration when drafting HIV control strategies.

Introduction
In Benin Republic there is a general HIV epidemic with a stable
prevalence of HIV infection since 2006. According to the 2011-2012
Demographic Health Survey (DHS), the HIV prevalence in the general
population stands at 1.2%; 1.4% among women compared to 1.0%
among men, with the stereotype of HIV1 representing more than 98%
of the cases. In pregnant women, it is 1.86% [1].
Since 1980, sentinel surveillance of HIV among target populations
(pregnant women, sex workers, Security men, long-distance truckers,
men who have sex with men (MSM) etc.) provides important
information on prevalence of HIV among the population in countries
with generalized epidemics.
With the increasing coverage of HIV screening, the new directions
of the World Health Organization and the Joint United Nations
Program on HIV/AIDS rely on the implementation of a surveillance
conducted among pregnant women attending prenatal consultations,
based on data collected from the PTME program [2,3]. Benin has a
national strategic plan to eliminate mother-to-child transmission,
having made available 946 PTME sites in 2016.
?e monitoring and evaluation of these strategies requires, among
other things, not only the control of the incidence and prevalence of
the infection, but also socio-demographic characteristics (age,
occupation, educational level, marital status, etc.) to evaluate the
impact of the disease of HIV prevention and care programs on the
dynamics of the epidemic and to guide activities toward combatting
this epidemic and the infections associated with HIV infection. ?e
objective of this study is to assess the HIV prevalence and sociodemographic
profile of pregnant women in one of the largest hospitals
in Benin.
Patients and Methods
It was a descriptive study conducted on data collected on a
retrospective manner over a period of 18 months, i.e. from January 1st
,
2015 to June 30th, 2017 at the “Hôpital de la Mère et de l’Enfant
Lagune” hospital. ?e population studied consisted of records of
gestational pregnant women received during prenatal consultation or
labour, during the study period.
Inclusion criteria: All pregnant women who were tested for HIV
with a positive outcome. ?e sampling was exhaustive.
HIV testing is done D?er counselling and getting the consent of the
pregnant woman during the first meeting. ?e Terms of Reference
allow for a sensitive test (determine). In case where the women are
diagnosed positive, a second discriminative test (Bioline) is conducted
to identify the type of HIV. In cases where the type of serology is
"undetermined", a blood sample is sent to the reference laboratory for a
new test made with ELISA and then Western blot; the serology test is
done again D?er 6 weeks if the type of HIV remains undetermined.
When the result remains the same, a search to determine the viral
genome is carried out. In case of negativity, we conclude either to a
false positive result (cross-reactions) or to an HIV2 or HIV1 variants
(group N or O).

Results
Prevalence of HIV infection amongst pregnant women
During the study period, 9554 women gave birth, out of whom 188
were HIV-positive, representing a prevalence of 1.9%. Our study
involved 149 pregnant women.
Epidemiological distribution by age and marital status
?e average age was 30 years old ± 5 years with extremes ranging
from 15 to 43 years old. ?e proportion of HIV-positive pregnant
women increases with regard to the age, with a minimum in the 15 to
19 years old age group (0.7%). It increases rapidly to reach 34.9% in the
30 to 34 years old group. ?ose aged less than 30 years old accounted
for 42.9% of the study population. ?ey were married in 45.6% of the
cases and lived in a monogamous family in 60.3% of the cases (Table
1).
Epidemiological distribution by occupation and level of
education
Half of the women only attended primary school (50.3%) and the
most represented profession was crD?swomen (67.7%). Most of the
women came from urban areas (83.2%).

Screening and serology status of husbands
Almost half of the husbands (41.6%) were not aware of their wives’
HIV status. Among those who were informed, 88.2% had done their
screening, out of which 51% were diagnosed negative (Table 3).

Discussions
?e prevalence of HIV during pregnancy in our study was 1.9%. ?e
2016 Demographic Health Survey (EDSB-IV) [1] reported a rate of
1.86%. ?e epidemic has remained stable for several years despite the
high number of prevention policies implemented. ?Ls stability needs
to be investigated as it could be a balance between high mortality and
high incidence, reflectLnJ failure of strategies in this context.
Higher rates are reported in Nigeria (6%) [3]; in Cameroon (7.6%)
[4]. In contexts of low levels of consumption of prevention of motherto-child
transmission services. In 2013 the prevalence rate was 14.4%
in Mozambique [5] and 6.7% in China [6]. In Brazil, a prevalence of
0.36% [7] was found in a population of 30,588 pregnant women.
?e average age of our pregnant women was 30 years old ± 5 years
with a higher prevalence of infection recorded with women aged 30 or
less. ?e same is true of the 2012 sentinel survey in Cameroon, where
nearly half of the pregnant women surveyed were young (49.3% aged
between 15 and 24 years old), with 75.0% aged under 30. ?ese fiJures
reflect the fact that it is young women in full sexual activity who are
most D??ected by HIV infection. ?e 2012 Demographic Health Survey
(ESDB) reports a slightly higher prevalence of HIV when women first
had sex at 16/17 years old than when they had sex at a later age (2.2%
vs. 1.4% at 18/19 years old and 1.3% in their twenties). ?Ls remark is
also true for the number of sexual partners. According to a study
conducted by Chandana et al. [8], 13% of Beninese adolescents and
young people have already had sex before the age of 15 with an average
age of 14.75 years old ± 2.18 years at the time of the first sexual
contact. Inadequate communication between parents and teenagers
and youth (p=0.003), father's level of education (p=0.0021), exposure
to pornographic films (p=0.025), were sLJnLficDntly associated with
early sexuality.
?e vast majority of the pregnant women went to school (82.5%),
out of which 91.1% reached primary or secondary levels and 8.9%
higher levels. In Benin, the rate of non-education of women is 80.8%
[1]. ?Ls observation is made in several countries in West Africa.
School-based sexual and reproductive health programs is a way of
reducing high-risk sexual behaviour among adolescents, but according
to Mason-Jones et al. [9], there is currently little evidence to suggest
that educational programs are only e??ectLve in reducing cases of
sexually transmitted infection or teenage pregnancies. Incentive-based
interventions that focus on keeping youth, especially girls, in high
school can reduce teenage pregnancy and sexually transmitted
infection, but other higher quality screenings are needed to confirm
this.
More than half of HIV-positive pregnant women were represented
by crD?swomen (67.8%) and 84.6% did not have a fixed income. Same
observation was made by Takassi et al. [10]. Due to low purchasing
power, finDncLDl and material dependence on men, women cannot
exercise control over their sexual relations leading to situations of sex
against material favours for their daily survival and that of their
children [11].
?e average parity was 1.75 and nearly ¾ of the women had given
birth at least once (73.8%). Takassi et al. [10] in Togo made the same
observation. According to the 4th pillar of PTME, all children under 5
years old, born from mothers diagnosed with HIV+
 must be screened
for HIV.
Coverage of HIV testing among men remains very low in lowincome
countries. In sub-Saharan Africa where HIV transmission is
mostly heterosexual, screening for both members of the couple
remains one of the major challenges for the prevention of sexual
transmission within the couple and the mother-to-child relationship.
In our study, almost half (41.6%) of the husbands were not informed
about the status of their wives. Among those who were informed,
almost 9/10 (88.2%) agreed to be screened. A study conducted by
Kabamba et al. [12] revealed that the majority of men consider that
screening their wives informs them of their own HIV status, thus
making detection of both members of the couple infrequent. Plazy et
al. [13] shows that couples-oriented post-test counselling seems
e??ectLve in improving marital communication around HIV. Integration
of the couple into screening programs and PTME is therefore
necessary.
Conclusion
Providing education to young girls, strengthening prevention
programs aimed at young people, barely educated (primary level) and
in the low income revenue sectors, integrating a couple approach in
PTME programs are few aspects to consider when designing and
implementing HIV control strategies.
