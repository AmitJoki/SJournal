Abstract
Heart Rate is an important physiological parameter for health monitoring. Heart Rate measurement with smart
phone is used by many people all over the world and different applications are developed. But, there are few
issues behind the proper measurement like motion, baseline drift, power line interference, low amplitude PPG, and
premature ventricular contraction and noise in the signal. While capturing red contact video of fingertips, miss touch
errors can produce significant variation in real result as noise gets incorporated. Similarly, high pressure on camera
and low pressure on camera can produce incorrect PPG signal and therefore, mislead to incorrect result. They can
be treated as noise and needs to be removed up to a level to keep up the originality of a signal to give correct BPM
rate. Here, in our study we have introduced an algorithm to get rid of certain percent of miss touch errors and thereby
calculate heart rate from noise free signal, accurately. Here in our study, we have focused on Non-Invasive PPG
signal based Heart Rate monitoring from skin blood flow using IR light at 900 nm wavelength. We have captured
contact unfocused video to capture PPG using smart phone and developed algorithm to remove some percent of
touch errors and followed by noise removal with 2nd Order Butterworth (IIR) band pass filter with frequency domain
analysis and Hann Windowing for leakage reduction. We have also completed a comparative study in between
Butterworth filter and Savitzky-Golay filter. The PPG is obtained from RED channel of the captured live video of
smart phone camera.

Introduction
Cardiovascular problem is one of the major concerns in these days
as majority of the people die from this problem annually. In 2015, it was
responsible for 31% of the total death and estimated around 17.7 million
people. The number is increasing alarmingly and sources claimed that
total estimated global cost of cardiovascular disease was $863 billion in
2010 and it might likely to increase by 2030 to $1044 billion. Here in
our study, we have focused on PPG signal that is measured from skin
blood flow using IR light. First target is to obtain smooth leakage noise
free PPG signal from Video on RED plane and thereby peak counting
from normalized signal and resultant value is multiplied by 60 (1
minute) to calculate the heart rate which is an important parameter
for cardiovascular monitoring, health coaching etc. It is non-invasive,
inexpensive, portable and convenient diagnostic tool. Analyzing PPG,
we can calculate Oxygen saturation (SPO2
), blood pressure (systole/
diastole), Heart Rate, Arterial age, vascular disease, HB Count, RBC
count prediction, circulatory and respiration monitoring etc.
While capturing red contact video of fingertips, miss touch errors
can produce significant variation in real result as noise gets incorporated.
Similarly, high pressure on camera and low pressure on camera can
produce incorrect PPG signal and therefore, mislead to incorrect result.
They can be treated as noise and needs to be removed up to a level to
keep up the originality of a signal to give correct BPM rate. Here, in
our study we have introduced an algorithm to get rid of certain percent
of miss touch errors and We have focused on smoothening SavitzkyGolay
filter instead of Butterworth filter, if can be used with inspiration
from one referenced paper and has performed a comparative study for
algorithm improvement.
PPG
Mobile camera detects Electro Magnetic radiation at 350-1000 nm
wavelengths and in that wavelength range; 700-1000 nm is IR radiation.
Infrared is a special form of invisible electromagnetic wave that can be
felt by heat. Visible light’s wavelength is 400-700 nm [1-5]. For better
picture, IR radiation is blocked by film or so called filter. If no IR
filters in the camera, pictures will not be as good as digital camera. For
capturing fingertip video, we must ensure that the touch is proper and
to check if fingertip is properly placed on camera or not:
• Touch Camera ? Capture Video of RED image
• Check Red Image Frame ?Average Pixel density
Average pixel count/frame, if>200: ‘Placed Properly’. Else ‘not
placed properly’.
If more contact pressure excreted on camera:
• Deforming arterial wall leads to wrong reading.
• Block micro circulation in the capillary.
• Pixel density / frame in Red plane<200 if pressure on a single area
and in case of uniform more pressure than pixel density/frame in Red
plane>200 but sudden up and down of pixel density.
• After FFT analysis of brightness signal flat line (Y=constant) is
produced.

• Results reduced correct frame count for brightness calculation.
FPS or flips per second or frame rate is a property of digital camera
to capture video of an object. Experiment has shown that human eye
can differentiate images at 16 fps but exact human perception is still a
research area and depends on human to human [6-10]. Standard FPS
rate is considered to be 30 fps to have a clear smooth video. In our
mobile, the general FPS range is 25-30 and we have used same value as
sampling frequency for filter design and other calculation (Figure 1).
PPG is used to determine variation in blood flow/volume in the
body which occur with each heartbeat. It reflects the blood movement
in the vessels that travels from heart to fingertips and toes through
the vessels in the wave like motion and it is measured optically with
the help of light intensity (as amplitude of the signal over time).
From light source/camera, light is sent to the tissue and part of it is
absorbed (DC part/Fixed Absorbance) and some part is backscattered
which corresponds to variation of blood volume (AC part/Modulated
Absorbance). This light is invisible and falls in the wavelength range of
IR. Its intensity variation graph gives us the heart beat graph over time.
Systole means more pressure is delivered by heart to pump out blood
and more blood on fingertip vessels and less reflective index and more
light absorption. It gives frames with darker intensities and vice versa
for diastole [10-12] (Figures 2 and 3).
The process can be summarized as: Cardiac cycle ? blood volume
change in tissue ? Ambient Light ? Illuminates skin ?Light goes to
the tissue ? RED image frame ? Calculates light intensity of the frame
? Receive data ? Signal ? FFT (Sampling rate and window) ? Heart
Rate Calculation.
Assumption
For age/condition/physical activity: 60-200 bpm is in general.
Here, Experimental purpose: 40-220 bpm=667 to 3.66 Hz. Sampling
Frequency=2* 3.66 Hz=7.32 Hz (Nyquist)<8 Hz. NB: DC component
operates at 0 Hz and low frequency noise up to 0.5 Hz so filtering at
above range will help PPG to get rid of DC and low frequency noise.
Conventional PPG Algorithms
Appropriate selection of sampling rate and the number of FFT
points result in good performance in real time HR calculation. We have
studied few available algorithms but found some issues with them while
trying to replicate in real life scenario with raw captured video [13,14].
• Multiple operation on signal like Filtering, FFT, windowing,
Smoothening are not producing correct result and originality of the
signal is lost.
• Mistouch errors are not considered.
• Pixel density is not analyzed for high fingertip pressure on camera.
• Few algorithms have considered fixed number of frames instead
of all.
• Default sampling frequency/fixed frequency resolution is
considered, but for PPG capturing from live video and HR
calculation depends on fps. It is directly proportional to HR
while other conditions are unchanged.
• Sometimes, No Noise filtering and only noise free signal has been
considered
• No Leakage coverage or filter stabilization is considered.
Proposed Algorithm
We have proposed one algorithm in this paper with below features:
· Sampling frequency is not fixed and it is round (fps) of captured
video so no hard coding or manipulation.
· Calculated Average Pixel density/frame on red plane and if it is
touched properly then value is considered else rejected ? Touch
error elimination.
· We have used FFT point as 128 and 2nd Order butter worth band
pass filter can be used for removing low frequency and high
frequency outliner noise.
· For filtering pass band is 40 bpm to 220 bpm.
· Filter stabilization of 1 sec is introduced to reduce fluctuations/
unnecessary frequency components.

· Assessment of pixel density if camera is pressed forcefully by
fingertips.
· Leakage reduction by introducing Hann FFT window to remove
DC if present at start up and no artificial high frequency when
signal is treated by the FFT.
· Calculation is performed on all captured video frames after
removing mistouch errors.
· Average duration of video considered 28-35 sec.
Algorithm
The algorithm is divided in two parts:
• Video processing and brightness signal obtaining.
• Signal processing, Filtering, Fft and Average Hr prediction.
Part A
Step 1: Capture contact unfocused RED image video of fingertip
and capture video for at least 30 sec.
Step 2: Calculate Number of frames and fps.
Step 3: Count average pixel density/frame on RED plane (pixel
variable).
Step 4: if pixel>=200 and pixel<=250 Keep it else ignore.
Step 5: set Fs as round (fps) (sampling frequency).
Part B
Step 1: Use 2nd order Butterworth band pass filter in the range of 40
bpm to 220 bpm to make signal lower and higher frequency noise free.
Step 2: Filter the signal with filter stabilization time=1 sec and
initial signal cut-off period to 0.
Step 3: Set WINDOW_START=6 and WINDOW_END=12
For n=1 to fix((length(y)/(2*fs))-2) % y=filtered signal
Do
y2=y(n*fs:(n*fs+FFT_size-1));% 128 as FFT size.
window=hann(size(y2, 2))’; % Hann window.
Y2=abs(fft(y2.*window)); %FFT calculation.
Calculate single-sided positive frequency as f2.
YY=abs(Y2(WINDOW_START:WINDOW_END));
Find local maximum in IR spectrum as local_max_i
pk_i=6-1+local_max_i;
HR(n)=f2(pk_i)*60;
End
End
% Take average value of heart rate.
HR=sum (HEART_RATE (2:(length (HEART_RATE) -1)))/
(length (HEART_RATE)-2);
AVG_Heart_Rate=round (HR).
Improvement Scope
We are currently working on performance analysis of this
algorithm with more test data set in real world keeping in mind further
improvement possibilities. We have noted below scopes that will be
covered in our next papers with more real world test case analysis:
• Optimization analysis on upper limit of pixel density (to find a
perfect range of brightness signal).
• Average optimum touches % calculation per video for calculating
HR.
• Introduction of Machine Learning for analyzing touch pattern and
thereby decision making.
• Correlation and Regression analysis.
• Experimental analysis on different smart phone videos.
• Factors affecting PPG while capturing video including heat by
flash.
• Optimization analysis on other noises like motion (using white
Gaussian Noise and Wavelet Analysis).
• Optimization analysis on HR calculation with different physical
activities.
Testing
For maintaining originality, we have manually captured red image
video of fingertips using mobile camera then used that raw *.mp4 file for
analysis in MATLAB software. We have captured all videos in average
voltage of light and at normal room temperature and at rest physical
condition. Then the result is compared with two devices like Dr. Trust’s
Pulse Oximetry and portable wearable BP Machine by MEDISANA.
For measuring heart rate, we have used below devices, software and
hardware tools:
Smart Phone: Moto G Turbo Edition
Android: 6.0.1
Camera: Rear
Software: MATLAB Signal and Image Processing Toolbox.
Version: R2017b Hardware: Acer Laptop, Intel Celeron Processor.
Hardware: Acer Laptop, Intel Celeron Processor.
Platform: Windows 10.
We have taken below HR readings from Dr. Trust with 1 min
interval in normal rest condition:
Left Fingertip: 77, 81, 80, 85, 82, 86, 75, 81, 80.
Right Fingertip: 83, 72, 73, 74, 81, 80, 79, 82, 83.
We have taken below HR readings from BP Machine by MEDISANA
with 2 min interval in normal rest condition: 90, 86, 88, 86, 87, and 82.
So the Average range lies in normal range 72-90 in 60 min. We have
captured 5 videos from Moto G Turbo and analysed.
Miss touch average pixel density per frame in red plane is less than
200 (bad contact or more pressure on single area of fingertip) and more
than 250 (more pressure and Non Red image ? Yellowish Orange).
In case of uniform more pressure, average pixel density/frame in
Red plane>200 but sudden up and down in pixel density and thereby
reflected in brightness signal.

Right hand, signal_1.mp4, fps=27, Touch error=4, frames=795,
HR=82. With touch error, HR=81 so, algorithm works fine and touch
error for only 4 frames at the beginning as Figure 4 and throughout the
remaining signal train, brightness is consistent and in the range and
no straight line in the signal. This is a perfect brightness signal with
uniform pixel density (Figures 5-8).
File
Left hand, signal_2.mp4, fps=28, Touch Error=0, frames=962,
HR=77. With touch error (=0), HR=77. Originality of the signal is not
lost. So, algorithm is giving expected data if there is no touch error as
well.
File
Left hand, signal_3.mp4, fps=28, Touch Error=86, frames=811,
HR=77. With touch error, HR=80 (Unreliable). Yellowish orange image
at the beginning (created flat line) and huge pixel density variation
due to finger movement covering the camera so pixel density>200 but
sudden up and down.
File
Right hand (intentionally miss touch is created), signal_4.mp4,
fps=28, Touch Error=56, frames=770, HR=71. With touch error,
HR=72 (Unreliable). It is because multiple touch error (<200 pixel
density) in longer span and yellowish orange image at the beginning
(created flat line). Limit % of miss touch error is under analysis for this
category of signal with irregular waveform.

Right hand, signal_5.mp4, fps=28, Touch Error=131, frames=815,
HR=68. With touch error, HR=66 so our algorithm tries to recover
signal from touch error. Non Red image Yellowish Orange, has produced
flat brightness value at the beginning and bad touch at the middle.
A good PPG signal train can be obtained from pixel density in red
plane/frame between 200-240 for most of the cases or sometimes little
high and range 200-250. So, we have kept the range in between 200-250
and working on this for detail level analysis if any external factor is
effecting its increment or not. In some cases, it has been observed that
camera stabilization is taking 1-4 sec and in that time non red picture
received which has pixel density>250 and flat line in brightness signal
plot which we have removed for gaining original brightness signal.
Butterworth Vs Savitzky-Golay Filter
Butterworth filter tries to keep frequency response as flat as possible
in its passband. It is an IIR filter. For low frequency signals, IIR filters
are very good and it has fast processing power. The order of a filter
means number of energy storage elements (Inductor/Capacitor) in the
circuit. We have designed below band-pass filter of 2n order where n=1
to pass frequency band of PPG signal in the range of [0.66 3.3].
Savitzky-Golay Filter is an FIR filter used to filter frequencies
outside the interest band and smooth the signal. FIR filters are always
stable due to for a finite input, the output is always finite and it has
property called linear phase. We have used 1st and 2nd order of SavitzkyGolay
Filter on entire frame length of the captured video from where
PPG signal is obtained.
Hd=designfilt(‘bandpassiir’,’FilterOrder’,order,’HalfPowerFrequenc
y1’,(BPM_L/60),’HalfPowerFrequency2’,(BPM_H/60),’SampleRate’,fs);
(Figure 9).
We have also checked if we can use it with Butterworth filter in the
same algorithm-first use band pass filter for filtering noise and then use
Savitzky-Golay Filter to smooth it and performed comparative study.
yf=sgolayfilt(y,order,framelen); %filter design. y is the input
brightness signal and yf is the filtered signal. Framelen is taken as entire
frame length of captured red video (Figures 10-12).

Comparative Study
In this study we have run our algorithm with two different filter
designs on signal_1.mp4 and signal_2.mp4 as discussed in this paper
and compared the result.
Conclusions
This study has opened up new challenges of PPG, digital signal,
image processing and filtering where attention to be paid for more
accuracy. All the observations mentioned here will be written down
in next paper with detail level of mathematical and experimental
study with more trial and signal property analysis with variation with
factors. We are currently focusing on performance analysis of this
algorithm with more test data set in real world keeping in mind further
improvement possibilities with other heart parameter measurements
which are important data sudden heart attack prediction. For the whole
assessment, accurate data/noise free image/noise free signal or test
data are highly required as it is very new area and related to health or
personal safety.
