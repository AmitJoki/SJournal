INTRODUCTION
“Breaking: Two Explosions in the White House and Barack
Obama is injured.” (The Associated Press, 10:07, April 23rd
2013) 72 characters later, the S&P500 index lost more than
121 billion US dollars until the tweet was proven false and
confirmed to be sent by a hacked Associated Press account. A
1.68 billion-dollar bill for each character written. However, this
particular event shed light on the implication of spreading news
on the stock markets, especially through social media.
Our research question is to know whether information running
through Twitter explain some of the stock price variations on
the S&P500. Twitter is a new way of spreading information,
not only through short sentences, but also by allowing users to
emphasize one particular piece of information by retweeting. As
such, is Twitter a complement to traditional ways of spreading
news, or is it a revolution? Applied to a particular market -
the financial market - this question takes a whole different
dimension. Indeed, information is at the core of finance. In
theory, there is no way to beat the market return. However,
when one investor has more information than another one, then
she can beat the market. In this regard, can we extract some
extra information from messages on Twitter that can lead to
some investors beating the market all the time?
Since the advent of modern finance, information has taken
a central role in every mechanism of the industry. While
Markowitz established the theoretical framework upon which
relies the Capital Asset Pricing Model, strong assumptions have
been made. Among them figures the fact that an investor will
act in a rational way in order to maximize her returns while
minimizing her risks [1]. Twenty years later, [2] characterized
the market efficiency regarding information: there should be no
gain opportunity on the stock markets because they are defined
by random walk patterns, while all information is known at any
time because prices instantly reflect new events.
These two assumptions have shown their limitations, especially
during financial crises (October 97, the Internet bubble or the
US financial crisis of 2007 for naming a few examples). If
crises cannot be explained by rational thinking à la Markowitz,
perhaps the emotional involvement of people is a potential
answer. Behavioral finance interprets financial markets as a
proxy to reflect the social mood [3]: crises could be provoked
by what [4] describe as “animal spirits”.
With the advent of social media and the democratization of lowcost
and efficient informatics systems, the wisdom of crown has
never been so accessible. Every day, 500 millions tweets are
publicly sent around the world. More than a billion users are
connected on Facebook. And this is only the tip of the iceberg.
Big Data is considered as one of the most promising futures for
finance, especially for risk management [5]. By using a robust
framework inherited form the financial industry, [6] developed
dashboards to manage risks based on social media scrutiny. We
define Big Data as a mix of structured and unstructured data
(stock prices, heartbeats and pictures for example), produced in
real-time as part of longitudinal data [7,8]. Highlighted the fact
that qualitative data can reflect information that is not optimally
incorporated into stock prices. In that sense, Twitter messages
fit the definition of unstructured data massively produced and
the social media became the subject of several studies in finance
and social sciences.
While many have used sentiment analysis technics or machine
learning approaches, few econometric analyses have yet been
published. “Twitter hedge funds” were highly mediatized
but did not earn the expected returns of the studies. Here lies
our challenge: how to assess efficiently the massive flow of
information for the financial markets? The main objective of
this research is to quantify investment opportunities following
an increase in Twitter messages depending on (1) weekdays and
(2) industry types. We expect that intraday and overnight returns
could be correlated with the volume of tweets being published.
To summarize, our overall research question is to know whether
new forms of information diffusion such as Twitter can add
to the current financial information flows and explain some
Abstract:
Objective: In this paper, we investigate the question to know whether information spread over Twitter can be useful to design investment
strategies on financial markets.
Methods: We compare the influence of two kinds of messages sent on Twitter over two types of returns concerning firms listed on the S&P500.
We use logistic-based models to assess the probability of having certain types of returns based on messages published on Twitter.
Results: Financial tweets are positively correlated with higher intraday and overnight returns (1 to 5% returns) while being negatively correlated
with lower returns (0 to 1% returns). Non-financial tweets are not significantly related to such returns.
Conclusion: From a practical standpoint, investment strategies could be designed following these findings to optimize some gain opportunities
depending on the investment day, the targeted industry and live activity on Twitter.

changes in stock returns. This leads to two sub-questions and
two hypotheses:
RQ1. Is there a difference between tweets exchanged after the
markets are closed and tweets written during the day, when
markets are open, in explaining stock price changes? For that
matter, we use two dependent variables: intraday and overnight
returns.
RQ2. Is there a difference between tweets written by financially
literate people (using company tickers) and tweets written by
the layman (using company names) in explaining stock price
changes?
H1. The first hypothesis is related to the first research question
in the sense that we assume that professionals tweet after they
are done at work, and their comments may be interesting for
investment decisions implemented on the next day.
H2. The second hypothesis is related to the second research
question in the sense that we assume that tweets written by
professionals (using tickers) provide more useful financial
information than tweets written by the layman (using company
names).
The rest of the paper is organized as follows: section (2) presents
the literature review concerning the use of Internet as a source of
information for the financial markets, including forums, search
engines and social media in the later years. In section (3), we
describe our dataset composed of stock prices and the number
of messages sent on Twitter about 71 firms of the S&P500. We
use logistic-based estimations, which are detailed in section (4),
while results are interpreted in the last section of the paper.
LITERATURE REVIEW
Forums and Blogging Websites
In early 2000, financial blogs were used to discuss about
stock performances [9] studied Yahoo! Finance comments to
understand the characteristics of the most spoken firms on the
website. He found that when the number of messages doubles
overnight, the following daily return is on average 0.18% higher.
RagingBull.com, one of the first financial forums, was also the
subject of a few studies. Through event studies, the impact of
messages cannot be anticipated by more than a day in advance
[10]. Trading volumes have also been correlated to the number
of messages written on the corresponding companies and thus
Internet messages cannot be considered as noise [11]. By
investigating topics shared on Engadget.com, a technological
blog, [12] were able to predict stock performances’ magnitude
in 78% of the cases (and 87% of the returns’ sign). Propagating
rumors on the Internet have been linked to trading volumes
using HotCopper.com website [13].
A second part of the studies regarding forums and blogging
websites focuses on the concept of opinion leadership. It is
opposed to the mass’ conformity and how false information
interferes with the wisdom of crowd: more precisely, [14]
interpret noise as distortion of a signal. An opinion leader is able
to influence the perception of other ones by accentuating his own
positions to balance the public’s inertia [15]. This capacity is a
key element towards understanding the importance of opinion
leaders inside a network. Identifying how connected a person
is and how novel the information transmitted is determine if a
person can be considered as an opinion leader on the Internet
[16]. These results can be used for predicting potential sales of
product or how a person’s network will be inclined to buy a
similar object [17,18]. Finally, [19] differentiate two behavior
of influencers: “agitator”, which is a person stimulating
discussions and “summarizer”, which is a person trying to give
a clear picture of a situation.
Search Engines
Search engines, by being the medium through which users
access information on the Internet, have become a valuable
source of financial data. Google has released Google Trends,
a tool aggregating the volume of search queries to interpret its
users’ behavior. Several billion queries are made every day, and
thus represent a huge opportunity in terms of Big Data analysis
[20]. For example, relationships linking search queries and car
sales have been [21].
In Finance, trading volumes of S&P500’s firms have been
positively correlated to search queries through Google Trends
[22]. This result was confirmed with other stock markets (Dow
Jones, CAC40, DAX and FTSE). By adding Google Trends
data, predictive models have shown more accurate explanation
capacities. However, search queries and stock volatility seems
to be mutually influenced, since “the investors’ attention to the
stock market rises in times of strong market movements [and] a
rise in investors’ attention is followed by higher volatility” [23].
In fact, search engines also appear to reduce the information
gap between investors: search engines could be used as a proxy
for “naïve” investors’ behavior [24]. Only a few companies are
widely looked on the Internet, but this non-expert point of view
could be interpreted as the wisdom of crowd regarding stock
markets [25].
Besides trading volumes, stock returns have tried to be anticipated
using a similar methodology. Sudden announcements of firms
with high growth and a narrow products’ offer are anticipated
using Google Trends [26,27] found that more queries about a
company leads to an increase in trading volumes, but also a
decrease of the expected returns. However, when maximum
(minimum) yearly values of stock prices have been reached,
the predictive power of Google Trends is increased (decreased).
Chinese stocks’ abnormal returns were studied using a similar
tool, Baidu Index, which counts the raw number of queries
made on Baidu’ servers [28].
The main limitation of Google Trends lies in the results given
to its users: only aggregated data is provided, on a weekly level.
Social media, by providing real-time and open information,
could become a more appropriate tool for financial predictions
[29].
Social Media
Even though Facebook gathers more than a billion users, only a
few studies were made in finance [30] used the social network
as a proxy for accessing the emotion of users. He created an
index called Facebook’s Gross National Happiness (GNH),
which takes into account updates from users’ status. A standard
deviation of the GNH is correlated with an increase of stock
returns the next day. In a now famous study, [31] showed
that emotions spread between users and could be manipulated
on the social network. Ethical questions aside, these results
reinforce the notion of a highly connected network that could
be influenced by its users, alike on the financial markets with
herd behaviors.

eToro was part of several studies released by MIT’s Media Lab.
Described as a “fun and accessible” way to democratized trading
[32], the social network was able to shed light on how likely
an information could become trending [33]. Also, researchers
found that the reputation of a user is not due to his past trading
performances but more to his links with other users [34].
Since its release in 2006, Twitter is the subject of studies in
various fields, including election outcomes, crisis management
or disease outbreaks. Few rules regulate the messages sent on the
social network: message cannot be longer than 140 characters
and can be referenced by the use of a “hashtag” (“#”) in order
to facilitate search regarding to a particular topic. For financial
purposes, using the ticker symbol preceded by the “$” symbol
is commonly adopted (i.e. $AAPL in order to write a message
about Apple, or $NFLX regarding Netflix).
In order to process the amount of messages sent every day,
several technics have been employed, and in particular sentiment
analysis [35] investigates the predictive power of emotion
through tweets by using a 6-level categorization method. They
found that messages associated to the emotion “calm” could
influence stock returns, and thus results could be anticipated as
far as 4 days in advance. Stock performances (returns and trading
volumes) are also linked to Twitter metrics such as sentiment or
message volume [36]. Stock prices seem not to fully reflect the
information publicly available, even though the information gap
tend to be quickly filled [37]. In a detailed econometric study,
[38] could not reproduce [35] impressive results but have been
able to predict 70% of the time the DJIA’s direction, 58.08% of
the time the NASDAQ’s direction and 68.63% of the time the
S&P500’s outcomes.
Due to the massive adoption of social media by Internet users,
firms have never been so exposed to the “buzz”. Adopting a
game-theory approach, [39] illustrated the importance of taking
into account words spread on the Internet and how to react to
a reputation crisis. A message could become out of control and
thus harm the firm’ stock price [40]. However, researchers have
also use Twitter as an opportunity for trading activities since
the information is not instantly incorporated into prices [41,42].
Derwent Absolut Return, commonly called “Twitter hedge
fund” at its beginning, used the methodology developed by
Bollen and al. but could not transform their theoretical results
into practical success [43].
This paper relies on a methodology inherited by the studies
using search engines, which is a volume-based methodology
instead of a sentiment analysis methodology. Our hypothesis
stipulates that investment strategies could be implemented in
order to maximize an investor’s gains on the stock market.
DATA
Structured Data: Stock Information
Financial data are from Yahoo! Finance database. We extracted
the following information regarding the 500 firms composing
the S&P500: opening price and closing price. These metrics
were established on a daily basis, for 251 trading days, starting
on May 1st 2012 and ending on May 1st 2013.
From these data, we define 2 types of return:
. = t t - t
t
Closingprice Openingprice Intraday return Openingprice (1)
1
1
. -
-
- = t t
t
t
Openingprice Closingprice Overnight return Closingprice (2)
We create dummy variables in order to control for weekdays
(Monday to Friday) and industry types following the Global
Industry Classification Standard (Energy, Materials, Industrials,
Consumer Discretionary, Consumer Staples, Health Care,
Financials, Information Technology, Telecommunication
Services, Utilities).
Unstructured Data: Tweets
Two types of messages were collected regarding the same
firms. (1) We collected the number of time a company was
named on Twitter per day (i.e. “Google” for Google Inc. or
“Microsoft” for Microsoft Inc.). (2) The second type of tweet
is called financial tweets, characterized by the presence of the
“$” symbol before the ticker of a listed firm (i.e. “$GOOG” for
Google Inc. or “$MSFT” for Microsoft Inc.). Data regarding
these two types were aggregated by day and also collected
from May 1st 2012 and May 1st 2013 using the People Browsr
website. For understanding purposes, the first type of tweets is
later called Name and then Name.Index, while the second type
of tweets is later called Ticker and then Ticker.Index.
From the 500 companies of the S&P500, we selected 71 of them
in order to only keep firms that have on average 30 financial
tweets per day. The list of queries used for the selected firms is
provided on Tables 1a & 1b.
In Table 2, we provide some descriptive statistics for each
variable.
Finally, we test the correlation coefficients between the variables
and provide the correlation matrix in Table 3.
METHODOLOGY
Our research question is to know whether tweets can explain
some of the variation in stock prices. In other words, is Twitter
one of the channels of financial information? Is it an evolution
or a revolution in finance? It is particularly interesting to study
Twitter and its impact on the financial market, because Twitter
(1) provides short messages forcing users to be to the point, (2)
is real-time, (3) allows the users to emphasize a message by
retweeting (hence creating a buzz) and (4) allows the users to
tweet only about financial products by using a $ sign before
the company name for instance. The latter point is of particular
interest from a statistical perspective, because it allows us to
have a great sample, covering almost all of the population
tweeting about finance.
Again, our research questions are as follows:
RQ1. Is there a difference between tweets exchanged after the
markets are closed and tweets written during the day, when
markets are open, in explaining stock price changes? For that
matter, we use two dependent variables: intraday and overnight
returns.
RQ2. Is there a difference between tweets written by financially
literate people (using company tickers) and tweets written by
the layman (using company names) in explaining stock price
changes?
H1. The first hypothesis is related to the first research question
in the sense that we assume that professionals tweet after they
are done at work, and their comments may be interesting for
investment decisions implemented on the next day.
H2. The second hypothesis is related to the second research question

in the sense that we assume that tweets made by professionals
(using tickers) provide more useful financial information than
tweets written by the layman (using company names).
From an econometric perspective, the methodology used for this
study relies on logistic estimations. Logistic models evaluate the
impact a variable over the probability that the studied variable
changes states. The dependent variable is reduced to a binary
variable that can be adapted to different models. In our case,
we evaluate the two different returns and implemented three
models concerning the magnitude of these returns, such as:
1
0 _1 { = if return is positive Model otherwise (3)
1 0 < 1
0 _2 { = = if return Model otherwise (4)
1 1 < 5
0 _3 { = = if return Model otherwise (5)
In order to assess the effect of Twitter messages on firms, we
control for two different types of fixed effects (weekdays on the
one hand, and industry types on the other hand). This allows
us to evaluate the specific impact of an increase (decrease) of
tweets depending on the weekday or the kind of industry, such
as:
( ,0 1 1 ) . . .. Pr ? a a ? ßt ?? ds e t f =+ + + + + t t t tt - - (6)
Where f = { _1; _ 2; _ 3} Model Model Model is the model
used for the selected return t, = {; } intraday overnight ? f
t t-1 ={ticker; name} the number of tweets published about
a company mentioning either its ticker or its name the day
before the studied return, the ?t weekdays and s t a value
corresponding to the Global Industry Classification Standard.
In terms of methodology, we compute the log-odds, odds-ratios
and predicted probabilities of our models, as well as testing the
validity of the impact of our variables by a Wald-test. Finally, in
our logistic estimations, we use Monday and the Energy sector
as our reference points.
RESULTS
We provide a summary of the logistic estimations’ results in the
following tables. Again, results have to be interpreted relatively
to the reference points. We should also pay attention to the low
R-squared values. They should be considered in the context of
an exploratory study. Also, although the values are low, they
have to be interpreted as follows: they represent how much
we can add to the level of information already available in the
financial markets.
Overnight returns and financial tweets
In Table 4, we compare the influence of financial tweets
regarding to the three models of overnight returns. Firstly,

Tickert-1 is highly significant (as confirmed by a Wald-test on
this variable) but its effect on the probability of having such
returns are opposite. In fact, for a unit increase in Tickert-1,
the log-odds of having an overnight return between 0 and 1%
decrease by 2.04 x 10-4 but for the third model (from 1 to 5%)
the log-odds increase by 1.846 × 10-4.
Secondly, holding all variables at their means (Tickert-1 equals
to 127 tweets, Weekdays being Wednesday and Overnight_
returnt-1 being 0.00012), the predicted probabilities of having
the three different overnight returns can be computed based
on the industry classification (Table 5). For the first model,
Industrials (54%), Health Care (51.3%) and Materials (50.8%)
are the industry types with the highest probabilities of having
such returns; for the second model, it is Telecommunication
Services (52.4%), Information Technology (48.7%) and
Consumer Discretionary (46.5%); for the third model, it is
Utilities (14.8%), Health Care (11.9%) and Industrials (10.8%).
Thirdly, we can compare these predicted probabilities for
different level of tweeting activity. Figure 1 provides such
analysis, with results depending on (1) the day of the week (1
to 5), (2) the type of industry (1 to 10) and (3) the number of
financial tweets published (from 0 to 10,000). Here, the more a

company is tweeted about, the less it is likely to have an overnight
return between 0 and 1% (while it has higher chances of having
an overnight return between 1 and 5%). Finally, weekdays and
industry types also influence these predicted probabilities.
Overnight returns and non-financial tweets
Our hypothesis stipulates that financial tweets (Ticker) provide
more information than non-financial tweets (Name). Namet-1 has
a p-value of 0.14 for Model 1 and is not significant for Model 2
(Table 6). The Wald-test confirms these results, while Namet-1 is
significant for Model 3. Also, the magnitude of the log-odds has
to be noticed between financial and non-financial tweets.
Again, holding all variables at their means (Namet-1 equals to

16288 tweets, Weekdays being Wednesday and Overnight_
returnt-1 being 0.00012), we can identify preferential industrial
sectors for having positive overnight returns, which are similar
than those previously mentioned in Table 4 (Appendix 1a).
When analyzing the impact of weekdays, industry types and the
number of mentions of a company simultaneously (Figure 2),
the impact of non-financial tweets seems to be limited compared
to financial tweets.
Intraday returns and financial tweets
As a reflection to the previous results, the impact of financial tweets
on intraday returns is significant (both for Models 1 and 2, as
confirmed by a Wald-test). The magnitude of Tickert-1 on intraday
returns is lower than on overnight returns, meaning that for an
increase of one unit in Tickert-1, the log-odds of having such returns
fluctuate less during trading time on the stock markets. However,
the sign of Tickert-1 remains the same (Table 7).

In Appendix 1b, we provide results for the predicted
probabilities of having the three models of intraday returns
while holding all variables at their means: Tickert-1 equals to
127 tweets, Weekdays being Wednesday and Intraday_returnt-1
being 0.00051. In Figure 3, the complete influence of weekdays,
industry types and financial tweets could be assessed. For
intraday returns between 0 and 1% (model 2), five industry types
present higher probabilities of having such returns, namely the
(1) Energy, the (2) Materials, the (3) Consumer Discretionary,
the (4) Information Technology and the (5) Telecommunication
Services sectors. Finally, Friday, followed by Monday, are the
two days of the week presenting higher intraday returns, across
all industries (Figure 3).
Intraday returns and non-financial tweets
In Table 8, we compute the log-odds and odds-ratios for each
model and found that the impact of Namet-1 is not significant

for positive intraday returns (Model 1) and between 0 and 1%
(Model 2). Again, the influence of non-financial tweets is lower
than financial tweets, as illustrated by the amplitude of the logodds
for each type of variables.
After computing the predicted probabilities of having the three
returns while holding all variables at their means (Appendix 1c),
Figure 4 confirms that using non-financial tweets for predicting
such returns is not effective.
CONCLUSION
Two main findings of this study have been established. Firstly,
financial tweets are more relevant to take into account compared
to non-financial tweets regarding intraday and overnight returns.
While the effect of the first ones does impact negatively on lower
returns (0 to 1%) and positively on higher returns (1 to 5%),
non-financial tweets did not help in explaining these returns.
Secondly, overnight returns are more impacted by financial
tweets than intraday returns, confirming our first hypothesis:
tweets contain information that seems to be reflected on stock
markets as soon as they open on the next day, which is less
capture during trading hours. From these results, investment
dashboard could be built, controlling for industry types,
weekdays and live-monitoring of Twitter data.
Being exploratory, our research has some limitations and
further work could be done in order to improve the quality of
our findings. Firstly, we only selected firms that are already
popular on Twitter (or at least having 30 financial messages per
day on average). Secondly, the impact of a single tweet is low
compared to traditional variables (returns of the previous day
for example). This can be interpreted as a result that Twitter
messages cannot fully explain returns on the stock market.
However, these unstructured data can add value to traditional
investment strategies based on more regular sources of
information. In this regard, Twitter can add some information,
being an evolution, but maybe not a revolution in finance.
In terms of estimation techniques, we think further work should
be done, for instance using a straight OLS while identifying
and correcting potential problems with unstructured data such
as potential non-linearity of the interacted variables, weak
extrapolation and severe interpolation. We could also implement
machine learning techniques such as neural network or clusterbased
analyses.
