Abstract
Sensitive skin syndrome is a common and important clinical condition not only to the dermatologists but also to
the skin care products and cosmetic manufacturing industries. The perception of distressing sensory symptoms like
pain and itch are translated to the brain through abrupt neuronal depolarization sometimes in normal circumstances
without any signs. Previously only regarded as an over reactive skin to cosmetics and toiletries, sensitive skin
gained increasing attention as a syndrome of aberrancy of the nervous system of the skin and the epidermal
keratinocytes. The following is a review on the history, epidemiology, pathogenesis and management of the
condition.

Introduction
Sensitive skin syndrome (SSS) is a complex, clinical, global and
public health problem [1-7]. In the past, many has neglected its
identity as a syndrome and merely regarded it as psychosomatic or
allergic reaction to cosmetics [8]. Epidemiological data worldwide over
the years has confirmed its real existence and significance [9-13].
Patients su??ered from SSS presented mostly with subjective sensory
symptoms sometimes with psychological consequences [14]. As
clinical signs are transient and few, diagnosing the condition in a busy
clinical setting is challenging. It negatively a??ects patient’s
Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) and Quality of Life (QOL).
SSS with its complications impacted a major public health burden to
the society and health care system. Extensive availability of irritant skin
care products in the markets with its misuse together with other factors
like pollutions, climatic and life style changes; an escalating prevalence
may be expected. ?e subsequent adverse reactions and patient
dissatisfaction with management may prompt medical litigations and
legal disputes.
'HfinLtLon
Misery clarified SSS as a syndrome characterized by self- reported
facial presence of di??erent sensory perceptions including tightness,
stinging, burning, tingling, pain and pruritus to a variety of factors [1].
?e subjectivity of this condition is well expressed in this definition.
Stander added the occasional objective sign of erythema [2]. Farage
and Maibach thought that the skin in SS is prone to the subjective
perception of irritation a?er using cosmetics and toiletries only [4]. In
2017, a special interest group of the International Forum for the Study
of Itch (IFSI) defined SSS as "A syndrome defined by the occurrence of
unpleasant sensations (stinging, burning, pain, pruritus, and tingling
sensations) in response to stimuli that normally should not provoke
such sensations. ?ese unpleasant sensations cannot be explained by
lesions attributable to any skin disease. ?e skin can appear normal or
be accompanied by erythema. Sensitive skin can a??ect all body
locations, especially the face" [15].
Historical Perspectives
Table 1 illustrated the historical description of SSS as cited in the
literature [16-19]. Interestingly, in the early years, SSS had been
described as an intolerant reaction to cosmetics, chemicals and
toiletries applied to the skin particularly over the face. As the
manifestations and pathogenesis of the syndrome was obscure, various
terminologies had been used. Reactive skin, overreactive skin,
intolerant skin and irritable skin were used synonymously as SSS in the
literatures. ?is inevitably made scientific and epidemiological study of
SSS di?cult and impossible. Advances in neurosciences and
collaborated worldwide data collection provide medical evidences SSS
is a common, prevalent and significant skin syndrome occurred in all
ethnic groups. [1,2,15]

Epidemiology
SSS is a common skin syndrome with overall world prevalence
reported up to 40% to 50% especially in USA and Europe [10, 11]. An
increased prevalence in the USA has been assessed by Farage [12].
?ere is a female preponderance in prevalence. Female gender is more
o?en a??ected but can also occur in man. Recent studies reported male
has an increasing incidence. In France; 59% women and 41% men and
in Japan 52% women and 48% men were reported to have experience
of the sensitive skin syndrome [1]. In subsequent study; although
di??erent methodologies employed involving di??erent skin prototype,
weather, lifestyle, culture; the sensitive skin phenomena were reported
almost worldwide: Brazil, Russia, United Kingdom, China, United
States, Japan and France [9-13]. Sensitive skin very o?en appears as
normal skin without any objective signs.
Figure 1: Transient Receptors Proteins (TRP) channels aberrancy
are main suspected pathogenetic factors.
?e subjective sensations of tightness, stinging, burning, tingling,
pain and pruritus may occur paroxysmal or exacerbated by triggering
factors include environmental physical changes; skin care products
used; ultra-violet radiation; skin type, air pollutions, heat, cold, wind,
diet, alcohol consumption, stress, emotional burden and hormonal
changes. Dry skin types, higher age and DLQI are other confounding
risk factors. Prevalence is reported to be increased in summer but there
is no di??erence found among di??erent age group, ethnicity and
occupation according to study. [20] SSS is not an allergic and
immunological skin syndrome and there is little to no
histopathological features apart from very mild non-specific
inflammatory cell infiltrate in the dermis. ?us, a detailed medical
history and a standardized questionnaire in the evaluation and
monitoring the subjective sensory perceptive discomforts and transient
redness of SSS is essential and mandatory. An epidermal skin barrier
impairment; peripheral and central nervous system signalling defects
and Transient Receptors Proteins (TRP) channels aberrancy are main
suspected pathogenetic factors (Figure 1).
Clinical Presentations
?e symptoms are subjective perceptions of skin tightness,
numbness, stinging, burning, pain and pruritus under normal
circumstance (see definition occur suddenly or secondary to known
triggering factors (Figure 1). ?e neurogenic nociceptive, pruritogenic
distress symptoms usually occur within one hour following exposure to
the triggering factors and may persist for minutes and even hours [2].
?e skin may look normal with transient erythema. Most notable
location of sensitive skin is the face but can happen in any parts of the
skin of the body includes hands, scalp, arms, genital areas, perianal
region, scrotum and the trunk. 70% reported extra facial presentations;
hands (58%), scalp (36%), feet (34%), neck (27%), torso (23%), back
(21%). [1,21,22] Currently, the diagnostic criteria, severity assessment,
etiology, therapy and clinical management are unresolved. While
facing suspicious presentations of SSS, important albeit rare occult
neoplastic, autoimmune, allergic drug and infective dermatological
conditions must be excluded. Regular and careful follow up of patients
are recommended. Important skin conditions that may mistakably
diagnosed as SSS are herpes zoster ophthalmicus; eczema herpeticum;
trigeminal and various forms of neuraglia, carcinoid syndrome with
facial flushing, mastocytosis and amyotrophic dermatomyositis.
Pathogenesis
Abnormal sensory perceptions, neuronal hypersensitivity, epidermal
barrier defects, Transient Receptor Potential (TRP) ions channels,
neurogenic and non-neurogenic inflammation interplay with the
central nervous system with subsequent perceptive cognitive behaviour
appears to be the main pathogenetic mechanism behind SSS.
Role of cutaneous nervous system in SSS
?ere is suggestion that the sensory perceptions in SSS are due to an
aberrant neurosensory circuitry [23]. Altered sensation in patients
with SSS may result from an insu?cient protection of epidermal
cutaneous nerve endings due to impaired cutaneous barrier integrity.
Intraepidermal nerve fibre density, especially that of peptidergic Cfibres,
was lower in sensitive skin. ?ese fibres are involved in pain,
itching and temperature perception and their degeneration may
promote allodynia and allokinesis. ?ese results suggest that the
pathophysiology of skin sensitivity may resemble neuropathic pruritus
within the domain of small fibre neuropathy [24].

Functional hyperactivity of cutaneous nerves
Functional cutaneous nerve fibres such as unmyelinated polymodal
C fibres mediating pain, itch and warmth are equipped with sensory
neuroreceptors such as endothelin, TRP channels, orai receptors and
serotonin receptors. TRP channels, endothelin; etc induce sensory
sensation and itch. TRP channels are located in nerve free endings and
keratinocytes surface membrane and also central nervous system. TRP
channels can be activated by di??erent heterogeneous physical,
chemical or thermal stimuli. which in parallel act as trigger of SSS
through Ca++ influx a??erent neuronal depolarization [25,26]. For
instance, it is well established that TRPV 1 is activated by capsaicin,
phorbol esters and heat; TRPV 3 by warm temperature and camphor;
TRPV 4 by heat, mechanical, hyperosmotic gradients and stress;
TRPM 8 by cold, menthol, wasabi and mustard; TRPA 1 by cold,
wasabi, mustard, horseradish and bradykinin. Ingredients in cosmetics
and skin care products which act as additives, preservatives may
contain TRP channels agonists, activators and antagonists (Table 2).
Examples of these irritants which act through TRPV 1 activations are
sodium lauryl sulphate; lactic acid; formaldehyde-releasing
preservatives alternatives like phenoxyethanol, flavour and fragrance
agents like trans-4-tert-butylcyclohexan-1-ol (TTBC). TRP channels
are believed to play a pivotal role in the perception and
pathophysiology of SSS [27].

Epidermal barrier dysfunction
?e stratum corneum is the principal barrier to irritants and
allergens and is involved in the regulation of trans epidermal water loss
(TEWL) [28]. ?e defective epidermal barrier maybe secondary to the
action of irritants, proteases and protease activated receptors (PAR).
?e abnormal epidermis clinically presented as dry skin increase
TEWL from the inner body to the outside environment while; in the
reverse; allows penetration and invasions of allergens, irritants and
pathogens from the outside to the inner body activating its immuneneurological
defence pathways. As mentioned, the broken epidermis
exposed the free nerve endings between the epidermal keratinocytes
which are well equipped with the sensory receptors like TRP channels
and others. Cytokines and immune mediators like prostaglandins may
be secreted and resulted in neurogenic inflammation through the
release of histamine from mast cells [29]. Substance P (SP) is also
known to be involved as in other inflammatory diseases both in the
skin and the spinal cord. Interestingly, sensitive skin has been linked
with atopy. Dry is more frequent in SSS but sensitive skin is not dry in
the majority of cases [30]. Patients with sensitive skin may have a
defective epidermal barrier characterised by a thinner epidermis, less
mature coenocytes, enhanced degradation of corneodesmosomes (due
to decreased expression of protease inhibitors, increased expression of
proteases and elevated skin pH), defective lipid lamellae, poor
hydration and reduced levels of natural moisturising factor. Hence, SSS
may be associated with an epidermal barrier dysfunction with
subclinical inflammation. Hillion in his study reveals there is no
dysbiosis of aerobic cultivable bacteria associated with SSS [31].

via a??erent neurons activates Gastrin Releasing Peptide (GRP),
Histamine 1-4 receptors in the Dorsal Root Ganglion (DRG) of the
spinal cord and Central Nervous System (CNS). ?e sensory signals
travel to the DRG and relay messages to the thalamus in the brain.
Movements with obsessive behaviour, emotional upsets, inattention,
sleep disturbances and psychological cognitive malfunction may result
from the subsequent imbalance of serotonin/ dopamine secretions in
the S2 somatosensory area of the cerebral cortex [32-34].
Diagnosis
A detailed and systematic clinical medical history is crucial in the
diagnosis, evaluation, management and follows up of SSS [30]. A 14
items and 10 items self- reporting sensitive scale questionnaires has
been developed and validated in evaluation and monitoring of SSS
[35]. (Figure 2) Strong indicators of sensitive skin is tautness, itching
and burning under certain triggering factors and transient erythema.
Objective tests and investigations like sensory testing methods,
stinging tests, 5% lactic acid tests, capsaicin test, dimethylsufloxide test
are not diagnostic and possess technical limitations and may not be
acceptable to the patients. [1,35] Previously, an electrical method to
simulate the sensory perception has been abandoned and become
obsolete. there is no international consensus or preferred method
recommended. ?ere is a pressing need to assess the subjective
symptoms of the patients of SSS to prevent possible complications and
co-morbidities. ?e best method to diagnose SSS is still utilizing a
patient self- reported scale.

condition a?er stopping the suspicious skin care products with
liberal use of non-irritant moisturizers without topical or systemic
steroids, Day 7: Complete recovery a?er continuous moisturization.
Management and treatment
As confirmatory diagnosis, severity assessment, long term outcomes
and possible complications of SSS are still not fully understood,
management of SSS is challenging and di?cult. SSS and its associated
complications like irritants dermatitis is a real clinical concern.
Figure 3 showed a patient presented with a long history of SSS
symptoms involving the face and hand developed acute irritant
burning, tightening and painful lower face and neck dermatitis a?er
applying skin care products containing irritant preservatives and
additives supplied by her own mother at home.

She recovered a?er stopping the causative skin care products, liberal
moisturizers, humectants and occlusive emollients and total avoidance
of systemic and topical steroids. Her gradual recovery was shown as
evident by the restoration of the healthy epidermal barrier.
Counselling, careful explanation and total abstinence of inappropriate
use of unsuitable or even dangerous skin care products are essential.
Public education particularly on the vigilant selection and application
of non-irritative, non-sensitive and safe skin care products like
cleansers and moisturizers are important management [36]. Recently
through understanding the possible pathogenesis of sensitive skin with
TRP channels, TRPV1 antagonists like 4-t-butylcyclohexanol and
licochalcone have been proposed in small scale study to be e??ective in
treating SS [37]. Non-steroidal, anti-inflammatory cream;
pimecrolimus; down regulate TRP receptors, decrease TWEL and
increase epidermal thickness may be used satisfactory but the patients
must be informed about the initial burning, stinging discomfort of the
compound. ?e use of drugs is not validated and may only reflect
doctor’s preference in using these drugs and have not been properly
investigated in clinical trials [38,39]. Low level laser and low- level
energy device like Intense Pulse Light has been shown to reduce
severity of sensitive skin in one study [40]. Two clinical trials were
performed in France and ?ailand, a new topical combination
cosmetic product applied in patients with sensitive skin, a preventive
soothing e??ect an immediate soothing e??ect and a soothing e??ect on
erythema were observed [41]. Last, not least, ingestion of probiotics
including Lactobacillus paracasei NCC2461 (ST11) strain has been
shown to reduce the occurrence of SSS in another study; though not
verified showed the complex interaction of the SSS with skin food
allergy and hypersensitivity of food in the gastro-intestinal tract [42].
Conclusion
With the advance of neuroscience and collaborative epidemiological
studies and researches, the puzzling condition of SSS begin to be
unveiled. Defective epidermal skin barrier, neuronal receptors
sensitization, neuropathic pruritus secondary to small fibre
neuropathy, neurogenic inflammation interacted with endogenous and
exogenous triggering factors resulted the distressing cognitive
perception of SSS. Local consumer councils, health departments,
managing doctors and skin care manufacturing industries are all
stakeholders and have a social responsibility in explaining, informing
and educating the public of all age groups in understanding and
preventing exacerbation of SSS. Dermatologists should take the lead
and act as gate keeper and participate in an active role in managing
and preventing this global public health problem.
