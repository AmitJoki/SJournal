Abstract
Slit-Robo could be a cell signaling pathway with numerous functions such as axon steering and ontogenesis.
Slit is a secreted macromolecule and most generally referred to as a repulsive axon steering cue, and Robo as its
trans-membrane macromolecular receptor. This ligand-receptor combination has been concerned in different kind of
neuronal and non-neuronal processes starting from cell migration to ontogenesis, tumorigenesis and organogenesis
like kidneys, lungs and breasts, etc.
Roundabout receptors (Robo) and their Slit ligands were detected in axon steering. Slit was primarily associate
degree extracellular matrix super molecule and expressed by plane interstitial tissue in fruit fly. Slits acted as chemorepellents
for axons crossing the plane in vertebrates and invertebrates. The origin of Robo proteins were from
fruit fly in an exceedingly mutant screening for genes concerned with the regulation of plane crossing. This ligandreceptor
try has been involved exceedingly in somatic cell and non-neuronal processes starting from cell migration
to maturation, tumorigenesis and organogenesis of tissues like kidneys, lungs and breasts, etc. This pathway act as
a substance receptor pathway where Slit proteins bind with Robo receptors and convert signals for axon steering
through plane commissures. Recent studies have confronted the role of this signal in numerous fields outside
ontogeny like maturation and cancer progression. Here the fundamental framework of Slit/Robo structure and its
general pathway with special stress on its operation in stomach cancer are summarized.
Keywords: Slit; Robo; Neurogenesis; Cancer progression
Introduction
Neurogenesis, a way of producing new neurons from neural
precursor cells observed through neuronic migration and
regionalization, is an inevitable incident for the occasion of systema
nervosum. In each invertebrates and vertebrates, plane cells, a group
of sign molecules, play a key role in the formation of the nerve fiber
commissures that adjoins left and right sides of the forming central
systema nervosum permitting communication between each side of
the body. The formation of commissures and connectives involves
each nerve fiber attraction and nerve fiber repulsion towards or
away from the plane that is radio-controlled by nerve fiber steering
molecules. Recently, studies have shown that Slit and Roundabout
(Robo) were thought to be the nerve fiber steering molecules as Slit/
Robo sign pathway directs nerve fiber walking, neuronic movement
yet because it promotes nerve fiber branching. Slit proteins are secreted
glycoproteins, extremely preserved in its structure that intervene their
functions by binding to their trans-membrane receptors referred to as
Robo receptors [1]. Slit acts as a chemo-repulsive sheet cue that binds to
the trans-membrane receptor Robo, that is expressed on the expansion
cones of target axons, to mediate sheet crossing [2-5]. Besides
dominant in the repulsion and migration of the axons, Slit/Robo
pathway conjointly contributes in ontogeny and tumor-endothelial
cell communication. Though it’s illustrious that the angiogenic stimuli
created by growth cells drives the epithelial tissue cells towards them,
the explanation behind the directional movement is unknown. Wang
Associate in nursing colleagues delineated a quirky mechanism for
growth-driven ontogeny by stating that tumor cells manufacture the
Slit macromolecule which will acknowledge tube-shaped structure
epithelial tissue cells through their expressed cognate receptor Robo
[6]. Angiogenesis, being one among the most important attributes of
cancer progression, are often targeted and Slit/Robo sign pathway is
often targeted for the therapeutic approach towards cancer.

Molecular framework of Slit/Robo
Initially, Slit proteins were known in pomace fly by the technique
of screening that was chiefly performed to observe patterns and
morbidity [7]. These square measure secreted proteins enabled to link
with extracellular matrix. Though these proteins share nearly similar
structures, they’re extremely preserved among species [8]. 3 Slit genes
square measure were found among vertebrates; Slit 1, Slit 2, Slit 3 that
code ~200 kDa of proteins. Each of those super molecules is formed
from four stretches of leucine-rich repeat (LRR) domains (D1-D4),
seven to nine cuticular protein repeats, one Agrin-Perlecan-LamininSlit
(ALPS) or Laminin G like domain and an amino acid knot at C
terminal.
Robo receptor genes were additionally found in Drosophila
melanogaster [3,5,9]. The Roundabout conformation owing to
interruption of the commissural axons on the plane of the ventral nerve
twine resulted in the naming of Robo receptors. These receptors are
giant trans-membrane proteins composed of 1000-1600 amino acids
having no chemical activity and are entirely addicted to downstream
communication for their functions. The Robo receptor ortholog varies
with species from being just one in Caenorhabditis elegans, 3 in chick
and Xenopusto four in mammals and zebrafish [10]. Except in class

Robo4, all alternative animate thing domains of those receptors have
5 immunoglobulin (Ig) like domains (Ig 1-5) and 3 fibronectin repeats
(FNIII 1-3). A protoplasm tail,being variable among species, with
many preserved motifs follows the transmembrane domain. Robo4
is exclusive by having solely 2 immune globulin and FNIII domains
[11]. Robo receptors are characterised by its substance binding
activity through that it binds specifically with the secreted Slit proteins
throughout steering.
Signaling pathway and mechanism of Slit/Robo
Signal transduction through Slit/Robo is principally downstream
and effectively mediated by protoplasm enzyme Abelson (Abl) and
simple protein and tubule complex body part influenced by Abl and
its effectors. Role of Abl is contradictory as its performance has been
argued to vary in several species. In pomace fly its Associate in Nursing
repressive result upon Robo activity [12] whereas in another study [13]
it has been shown to own a promoting result of repulsive plane steerage
on Robo receptors by Abl macromolecule. In chick retinal cells, a
molecular advance is created between Robo1 and N-cadherin that is
totally controlled by Abl effector. This advance is snapped followed by
the engagement of Slit ligands which ends within the loss of N-cadherin
mediated cellular division through ß-catenin by Abl [14,15]. GTPase,
small GTP binding macromolecule, is meticulously concerned during
this sign pathway because it will modulate cell polarity and movement
by rearranging the complex body part. Dock/Nck protein forms a
crucial association between GTPase and upstream sign wherever it
binds to pomace fly and class Robo receptors, activating nerve fiber
branching and outgrowth in plant tissue neurons in vitro [16-18].
Slit/Robo GTPase activating macromolecule (srGAPs) illustrious
for dominant GTPase were found in Yeast [19] and srGAP2 mediate
downstream sign controls Rac1 activity in protrusion of cell in cell
overlapping zone. Directed movement at the forefront is non-heritable
by the repolarization of the cell referred to as contact inhibition of
locomotion (CIL). Recent studies have urged another RhoA dependant
GTPase activating macromolecule, Myo9b which may bind on to the
living organism domain of Robo1 [20] inflicting inhibition of Myo9b
and in broader sense inhibiting carcinoma cell metastasis.
Slit/Robo signaling in cancer development
Slit/Robo signal has been found to own an inevitable link with cancer
progression. Once the initial report of gradual studies have shown the
deletion of deoxyribonucleic acid two of Robo1 in respiratory organ
and breast tumor cell lines [21,22]. In many forms of cancer epigenetic
modulations are found like hypermethylation of Slit and Robo proteins.
Activation of Slit/Robo pathway successively activates completely
different oncogenic pathways that terminate in cancer. In most cases
lowering of Slit/Robo expression is taken into account to be the cause
behind tumorigenesis since Slit/Robo will inhibit cell invasion and
migration. Slit/Robo trigger necrobiosis in body part cancer by Slit2-
Robo4 interaction wherever the activated Robo4 subdue the expression
of netrin-1(a tumor suppressor protein) by interacting with it leading to
the dissociation of netrin-1 from its receptor DCC (axon steerage receptor
deleted in body part cancer) resulting DCC regulated necrobiosis in
cancer cells by activation of caspase-3 and caspase-9 [23,24]. This
inhibition of netrin-1 binding to its receptor may also be non-heritable
with Slit2 interaction with netrin-1. the foremost operation of Slit/Robo
pathway in bar of cancer is suppression of metastasis of cancer cells as
according to carcinoma and body part cancer wherever cell invasion
has been ceased by interaction of Slit/Robo with E-cadherin and
ß-catenin [25,26]. In cancer of the liver, hepatocyte protein mediated
cell invasion is prevented by Slit2/Robo4 interaction [27]. HGF is
activated by its substance Met through substance receptor binding that
promotes tumor cell metastasis and formation of various carcinomas.
Not solely cancer cells, recent study have unconcealed the prospect of
Slit-3 macromolecule in the migration of malignant melanoma cells by
modulating matter protein-1 [28]. Supported the signal mechanism
and kinds of cancer, Slit/Robo pathways otherwise management cell
movement and invasion. Though the reason for this differential activity
in numerous forms of cancer remains unclear, it is believed that Slit2
binds additional specifically with its Robo-1 receptor than different
2 slits (Slit-1 and Slit-3). On the context of cancer progression Slit/
Robo pathway suppresses tumorigenesis by modulating activities like
cell metastasis, cell necrobiosis and cell migration. Whether Slit/Robo
axis will initiate cancer or not is unknown however its expression can
undoubtedly inhibit cancer progression.
Role of Slit/Robo signaling in gastric cell carcinoma
The major action of Slit/Robo pathway is to hinder cell migration
and metastasis however in some sort of cancer this activity differs and
there Slit/Robo pathway acts favorably to growth cell metastasis. Such
incidence is seen in viscous cell malignant neoplastic disease (GC) where
Slit/Robo interaction triggers growth metastasis. Microribonucleic acids
(miRNAs or microRNAs) play an important role within the regulation
of viscous malignant neoplastic disease. These square measure short,
present, non-coding polymer molecules generated from pre-miRNAs
that negatively modulates organic phenomenon. This square measure
found to integrate into RNA-inducing silencing complexes and try with
the 3’untranslated regions of specific mRNAs to induce degradation
or to forestall the interpretation of the mRNA [29]. Cell proliferation,
apoptosis, invasion and metastasis is regulated by miRNAs. In studies
regarding invasive and noninvasive cells, a complete of 45miRNAs
square measure found to be otherwise expressed among that miR-218 is
found to be closely correlative with rate metastasis and invasion. Recent
experiments and diagnosis have reported concerning the lowering of
miR-218expression in many solid tumors that features rate, glandular
cancer, carcinoma [30-33]. Bioinformatics dependent studies have
discovered that miR-218 interacts with Robo1 receptor to alter the
cell motility in rate. A feedback loop is created between Slit, miR-218
and Robo1 within which miR-218 comes from either of 2 genes placed
within the introns of 2 distinct Slit super molecule friends. As Slit act
as the substance of Robo receptors, miR-218, happiness from same
molecular family, conjointly act as the substance of Robo1 receptors.
Slit3, one among the host genes, is suppressed at the side of miR218
in malignancy cells. Suppression of miR-218 upregulatesRobo1
(one of the many Slit receptors) expression by elimination of Robo1
repression and leads to the interaction of Slit2/Robo1 that facilitates
growth metastasis. Restoring high level of miR-218 will forestall Slit2/
Robo1 interaction and inhibits cell invasion. This phenomenon not
solely provides associate degree insight to the differential activity of Slit
proteins however conjointly discovered a completely unique miRNA
mediate regulative mode of receptor sign. Therefore miR-218 is a
possible target for interference growth metastasis.
Conclusion
Though at first Slit/Robo signal was concerned exceedingly in axon
steerage however recent studies and experiments were incontestable and
used it in a broader facet outside the system. Its diversity and specificity
in varied species have additionally shown its biological process
multiplicity. Class Robo3 and Robo4 don’t bind Slit as ligands and
have non-heritable different molecules as ligands, creating them totally

different from authentic Robo1 and Robo2 receptors. Equally totally
different Slit receptors like Eva1C, plexin A1, Dscam1 and dystroglycan
have additionally been known. Slit/Robo pathway has anticancer result
and thus therapeutic approach towards varied cancer can be achieved
by targeting this pathway. Simple protein deacetylase inhibitors may
be used to revive Slit/Robo expression. Researches and studies on Slit/
Robo pathway remains within the basic and initial level as there are
several queries relating to varied mechanism of Slit/Robo area unit still
unrequited. Multiple XT signal has to be studied and regarded before
declaring any conclusion. There’s an enormous potentiality of this
pathway to be thought-about as a therapeutic target of assorted kinds of
cancer however a large analysis and studies are required.
