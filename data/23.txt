Introduction
Professor Mostafa A El-Sayed has been giving new
ideas to the science community all over the world for
six decades. I am confident that he still has many
things to offer even at the age of 85 when others
choose to simply retire. The Electronic Journal of
Biology (EJBio) is launching this special issue in
celebration of his 85th birthday of Professor El-Sayed
of the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry at
Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta, Georgia,
USA. Prof. El-Sayed has received his B.Sc. from
Ain Shams University in Cairo, Egypt, and his Ph.D.
from Florida State University (under the guidance of
Professor Michael Kasha). He spent a Postdoctoral
Fellow at Yale University (1958-1959) and another
research stint at Harvard University (1959-1960),
then at California Institute of Technology between
the years 1960-1961. Before moving to Georgia
Tech, he held a long tenure position (33 years) at
the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry at
University of California-Los Angles (UCLA) between
1961 and 1994 [1,2].
There are no biology or chemistry or physical science
freshman students whom are usually majoring in
Science Technology, Engineering and Mathematics
(STEM) who do not know about the Lewis Dot
Structure of simple molecules. Gilbert Newton Lewis
who introduced the Lewis Dot Structure that STEM
students are familiar with is the scientific grandfather
of Professor El-Sayed. Prof. El-Sayed finished his
PhD under the guidance of Michael Kasha (who
finished his degree under Lewis at the University
California Berkeley). It is no wonder that Prof. ElSayed
over the last five decades has achieved at
least three dozen awards of the highest eminence.
It will suffice to mention half dozen rewards. (1)
Guggenheim fellowship award for natural sciences
(1965). (2) King Faisel International Prize for
Sciences (1990). (3) Irving Langmuir Award which is
considered to be the highest ACS award in physical
and biophysical chemistry (2002). (4) The National
Medal of Science (2007) for his pioneering and
creative work for our understanding of the optical and
electronic properties of Nano Materials. (5) Ahmed
Zewail prize in molecular Sciences (2009), and (6)
The Priestley Medal (the highest ACS award for
chemical sciences, 2016).
Nano Technology is defined as “The manipulation of
matter on an atomic, molecular, and supra-molecular
within the nanometer (nm) scale. Typically, Nano
technology manages particles in the range of 1 nm
to 100 nm in size. Over the last three decades, there
has been a proliferation of journals that carry the
theme Nano Science and Nanotechnology. Professor
Mostafa A. El-Sayed is considered by the scientific
community to be the pioneer and the authority on
Nano Technology. A naive and quick Goggle Scholar
Search shows that he is one of the most cited
scholar of all times. With over one hundred thousand
(100,891) total citations, as of March 29th, 2018 and
an h-index value of 118, I have to say very few people
will ever reach such numbers.
We will give a glimpse of the two most influential
papers he ever published along with his students,
postdoc associates and coworkers. 1) The, 78 pages
long, seminal review by him and his co-workers in
Chem. Rev. 2005 which contained 921 references
therein is the most influential paper ever in the history
of ACS with 6776 citations to date [3]. 2) The second
most influential paper is the 17 pages, 1999, J Phys
Chem. section B paper by himself and Dr. Link in
which they cited 137 references therein [4]. After the
publication of the second paper, I remember it became
fashionable among scientists to brag that they are
working on Nanodots and Nanorods, a term coined
by Prof. El-Sayed. Furthermore, he is the pioneer of
the term of Plasmon. It is clear from these two seminal
papers the great work done in the new area of Nano
Sciences introduced by Prof. El-Sayed. There are
many achievements that one can cite for Professor ElSayed;
the most notable achievements are the areas
of photochemistry, ultrafast LASER spectroscopy,
time-resolved Raman spectroscopy, and the El-Sayed
Rule to name a few [5]. He was honored by former
two USA presidents; in 2007 he was honored in the
white house by George W. Bush with the US-National
Nano Biology, Nano Chemistry, Nano Medicine or Nano
Technology Professor Mostafa A El-Sayed

Medal of Science in Chemistry. Also, in 2014 he was
appointed by Barak Obama as a member of the
president’s National Medal of Science Committee. I
will refer the reader to the complete biography and the
complete profile of professor El-Sayed at the website
of Georgia Institute of Technology [6].
I had the honor of meeting Prof. El-Sayed many
times during the ACS-National meetings. The first
time however, was during the bi-annual Gordon
Research Conference for Metals in Medicine in 2014
at Andover, New Hampshire. During that conference,
the author learned a great deal from Prof. El-Sayed’s
seminal presentation in Nano Medicine and cancer
treatment. Without asking him, he started giving
valuable advices to the author as if he is his own
postdoc associate or PhD student. I learned later that
I was not alone in that regards in which the author
learned that Prof. El-Sayed gave many valuable
advices to Former Noble Prize Laureates such as
the late Professor Ahmed Zewail. We wish Professor
Mostafa EL-Sayed a long, healthy, productive, life
full of more contribution to science and the scientific
community. We also wish him gaining more deserving
prizes to add to his lengthy list of awards and prizes.
